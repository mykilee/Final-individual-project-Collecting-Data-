The University of Groningen (abbreviated as UG;[5] Dutch: Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, abbreviated as RUG) is a public research university of more than 30,000 students in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands. Founded in 1614, the university is the second oldest in the country (after Leiden) and one of the most traditional and prestigious universities in the Netherlands.

The University of Groningen has eleven faculties, nine graduate schools, 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175-degree programmes. The university's alumni and faculty include Johann Bernoulli, Aletta Jacobs, four Nobel Prize winners, nine Spinoza Prize winners, one Stevin Prize winner, various members of the Dutch royal family, several politicians, the first president of the European Central Bank, and a secretary general of NATO.[6][7][8]

The institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.[9][10][11]

The coat of arms of the university was confirmed by The Estates of the City and County of Groningen in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.

In the first 75 years of its existence about 100 students enrolled every year.[citation needed] Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first rector magnificus, Ubbo Emmius, came from East Frisia in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region.[citation needed]

The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by ‘Bommen Berend’ in 1672.[citation needed] On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period.

During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administered by the Imperial University of Paris. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen). During this time period, it remained the only open university in the Kingdom of Holland.[12] In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. A fire completely destroyed the building in 1906.

In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the ""Rijksuniversiteit Groningen"" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the university was given a research as well as an educational duty.

The University of Groningen developed during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students grew rapidly. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had grown to 1,000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. In recent times there are about 32,700 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.

In March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the China Agricultural University to establish a campus in the Chinese city of Yantai. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.[13] The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by censorship in China.[14] In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the ""insufficient support for the project"".[15]

Key facts and figures about the University of Groningen are:[3]

The university operates under the BSA system, under which a first year undergraduate (bachelor) student must achieve a certain number of ECTS in order to progress to the second year. This varies from 30 ECTS to 45 ECTS among various degrees.[17]

RUG has its own newspaper: the Universiteitskrant.[18]

The university's Center for Information Technology (CIT) houses an IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer and data center of Target used by the LOFAR project as well as a Virtual Reality and 3D-visualisation center.[19]

The RUG has 6,250 employees.[38]

The university library was renovated between 2013 and 2017.[39] The RUG has a branch in Leeuwarden.[40] Plans to establish a ""branch campus"" in China's Yantai were called off in January 2018, and the University Museum is now in the process of being established.[41]

The University of Groningen is represented in the Academic Heritage Foundation, a foundation that aims to preserve university collections and cultural treasures.[42]

The University of Groningen is organized in eleven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, law, economics and business, spatial sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences and technology. Each faculty (cf., College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers bachelor's, master's, PhD, and exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.

Since 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent liberal arts college, University College Groningen (UCG).[43][44]

The University of Groningen engages in many types of international cooperation throughout both teaching and research. The main networks and partners[45] of the university are:

The various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the Broerstraat. The faculty of medical sciences is located close by at the University Medical Center Groningen(UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after Nobel Prize winner Frits Zernike. The Zernike campus is also shared by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.[49]

The university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a Starbucks on its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in Leeuwarden, Friesland, referred to as ""Campus Fryslân"", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.[50]

The city of Groningen is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. The university, through ACLO,[51] offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.[52]

The university also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.

The use of bicycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as ""The World Cycling City"" because of this.[53]

The University of Groningen does not have student accommodation. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via SSH Student Housing, which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands.[54] A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however, a recent addition to the housing options for students is The Student Hotel as well. In an effort to combat the annual housing shortage, the city of Groningen has incentivized the construction of short-term accommodation such as The Village which is made of shipping containers for international students.[55] The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.[56]

In 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.[57] Especially in the fall semester of 2021 the housing crisis hit its peak with hundreds of students reportedly not having any accommodation and resorting to emergency shelters. [58] The housing shorting evoked a protest in the city centre which culminated in the Academy building being temporarily occupied by students to put pressure on the city to extend emergency housing. [59]

In 2019, 708 PhD students were admitted to a PhD programme (compared to 816 in 2018). Around 50% of the admitted PhD students came from abroad. In 2019, a total of 546 PhDs took place, 22 of them cum laude. The national share was thus around 11%.[60]

The University of Groningen's Graduate Schools are organized somewhat different from its international counterparts.[69] The main difference is that the Graduate Schools do not contain all Master's programmes; Graduate Schools manage and facilitate the two-year Master's programmes: top master's degree programmes and Research master's degree programmes.

Notable alumni of the University of Groningen include:[70]

Heads of Government

Radboud University (abbreviated as RU, Dutch: Radboud Universiteit, formerly Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen) is a public research university located in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The university bears the name of Saint Radboud, a 9th-century Dutch bishop who was known for his intellect and support of the underprivileged.

Established in 1923, Radboud University has consistently been included in the top 150 of universities in the world by four major university ranking tables. As of 2020, it ranks 105th in the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities.[4] Internationally, RU is known for its strong research output. In 2020, 391 PhD degrees were awarded, and 8,396 scientific articles were published.[5] To bolster the international exchange of academic knowledge, Radboud University joined the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities in 2016.

Among its alumni Radboud University counts 12 Spinoza Prize laureates and 1 Nobel Prize laureate, Sir Konstantin Novoselov,[6] the discoverer of graphene. Other notable alumni include former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dries van Agt, former chairman of Unilever Marijn Emmanuel Dekkers, influential priest and theologian Henri Nouwen, biologist Frans de Waal and First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans. Former students have also won 3 Olympic medals since 2000, all in rowing.

Radboud University's coat of arms was designed at the time of the founding of the university by the goldsmith workshop of the Brom family in Utrecht. The lower part represents the coat of arms of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. The dove in the upper part of the coat of arms is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The entire shield is surmounted by the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire because Nijmegen was once home to Frankish King Charlemagne. Underneath the coat of arms one finds the university's motto ""In Dei Nomine Feliciter"",[7] meaning ""happily in the name of God"". The coat of arms is used on most of the university's official documents, including the university's bachelor, master and PhD certificates. For 2023 a special version of the coat of arms was designed to celebrate Radboud University's 100 year anniversary.

The establishment of a university in the city of Nijmegen goes far back. The first University of Nijmegen was founded in 1655 as the Kwartierlijke Academie van Nijmegen. Students developed their skills in the traditional fields of theology, medicine and law. Although the university had its successes, the Kwartierlijke Academie terminated around 1680. The university was unable to recover from successive outbreaks of the plague and the French invasion of the Netherlands in 1672.

After several attempts to establish a new university in Nijmegen, the current Radboud University Nijmegen was established in 1923 under the name Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen (Catholic University of Nijmegen). It was founded by the Saint Radboud Foundation, a network of bishops that wished to emancipate Catholic intellectuals in the Netherlands. At the time, Dutch Roman Catholics were disadvantaged and occupied almost no higher posts in governmental and scientific institutions. The establishment of a university was seen as a possible stepping stone for these individuals.

When the Catholic University of Nijmegen was founded, every student automatically became part of student corporation N.S.V. Carolus Magnus [nl], named after the Frankish king, Charlemagne, who used to reside in Nijmegen in the Middle Ages. This organization was set up to speak for  student needs and to organize an annual induction ceremony. It also aimed at attaining the same status as other corporations in the well-known Dutch student cities of Leiden, Delft and Groningen. To the horror of the Catholic University's management, Carolus Magnus also pursued the same liberal elitist character as these other corporations. Still, it continued developing and students eagerly participated. In the 1920s it produced its own sociëteiten: male students became part of Gentleman's Roland Society  (1928) and female students joined the Ladies Society Lumen Ducet (1929). Some students of these sociëteiten banded together in smaller communities called disputen.

The first years after the establishment of 1923 were quite successful for the Catholic University of Nijmegen, but during the Second World War the young university encountered serious difficulties. Many prominent members were lost, among them the anti-Nazi professors Robert Regout and Titus Brandsma who  were deported to Dachau concentration camp and died there. As the war progressed, the university was more severely curtailed in its freedoms. The German Sicherheitsdienst (security service) removed so-called ""anti-German works"" from the University library. In addition, professors could only be appointed after approval by the Nazi Department of Education, Science and Cultural Protection. Such measures aimed at eventually eliminating religious institutions of higher education. There would be no place for a Catholic university in a nazified Netherlands.

In March and April 1943, the conflict with the Nazi occupying forces reached a boiling point. The occupiers demanded that all students in the Netherlands sign a declaration of loyalty. If they did not, they were not allowed to continue their studies and had to work in Germany as forced laborers. However, students in Nijmegen showed to be resistant to the German demands. At the risk of his own life, law student Jozef van Hövelleven launched a widespread campaign to get as many students as possible not to sign.

The university's rector magnificus at that time, Bernard Hermesdorf, decided to show solidarity with students like Jozef van Hövell. As the only Dutch rector in the Netherlands he refused, for ""reasons of principle"", to distribute pre-printed loyalty statements to his students. Although heroic, Hermesdorf's refusal led to extreme anger among the occupying Nazi forces. On May 5, 1943, the Germans demanded all Nijmegen's non-signatories of the loyalty statement to report to Ommen within 24 hours to be put to work in Germany. If they did not, their families would be held responsible. These circumstances left rector magnificus Bernard Hermesdorf with no choice but to close the doors of the university as of April 11 1943, pending better times. Eventually, only 83 students decided to report to the Germans in Ommen. Most of the students went into hiding, scattered across the Netherlands. The great spider in the web during that time was university moderator Bernard van Ogtrop, who traveled all over the country to visit students from Nijmegen in hiding. He wrote circulars, took care of a wide-ranging correspondence, and ran a parcel service and thus managed to keep many people's spirits up. The university was closed, but thanks to Van Ogtrop it continued to exist, if only in the minds of the students.

When the war ended in 1944, the university infrastructure had been largely destroyed, but students still returned to their alma mater in dribs and drabs. Classes officially resumed again in March 1945, but because many university buildings had been bombed during the war, a dire need for new facilities existed. With the purchase of the Heyendaal estate, the university got its own campus in a green setting less than a fifteen-minute bike ride from the Nijmegen city center. In 1951, the Faculty of Medical Sciences was the first faculty to move to Heyendaal. Soon, other faculties followed. By 1988, all faculties had moved to Heyendaal. The move to a new campus also with a rise in students attending the Catholic University of Nijmegen. Since the end of the war, student numbers steadily rose from 3,000 in 1960 to 15,000 in 1980.

The period between 1960 and 1975 is often generally described as the ""Age of Student Unrest"". Not only did the student population in Nijmegen rise exponentially, it had also become more diverse, left-leaning and less elitist. Next to that, the hippie movement had reached the city which caused many students to desire a more democratic student life. Umbrella organization Carolus Magnus became increasingly bloated and lost connection with the members of sociëteiten and disputen that began to operate more independently. It was not the beloved corporation it used to be and students criticized the mandatory membership of Carolus Magnus. Therefore, the organization slowly became more concerned with administrative duties than organizing community activities. In 1966 Carolus Magnus ceased to exist in its traditional sense. From that moment on, students were free to choose which association they joined and which not. In the 1980s and 1990s many other kinds of student associations were established in Nijmegen, including evangelical-Christian association Navigators, egalitarian association Ovum Novum, and alternative student association Karpe Noktum.

As an indication of its evolving relationship with the Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands and to appear less sectarian, the university's executive council changed the university's name in 2004 to the Radboud University Nijmegen after Saint Radboud of Utrecht, a medieval bishop. Tensions continued between the university's executive council and the bishops' conference over the secularizing direction of the university. The repeated nomination of non-Catholics and non-practicing Catholics to the executive council, which the bishops' conference would not approve, exacerbated tensions. In response to a decision to open a Transgender Care Center at the university's medical center, the bishops' conference revoked the designation Catholic from the university in November 2020. Accordingly, the university lost its eligibility to receive church subsidies and its right to identify as Roman Catholic. The university appealed to the Holy See, and in November 2022 the pope's Dicastery for Culture and Education ruled that the bishops' conference could remove the designation ""Catholic"" from the executive council but not from the university as a whole.[8]

Radboud University is organized in seven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, law, management, philosophy, theology and religious studies. Each faculty (cf., College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes.

Radboud University is noted for its green campus, often listed among the most attractive in the Netherlands. The campus is located in the southern Heyendaal estate of Nijmegen and houses 7 faculties that conduct teaching and research. In addition to these faculties, the campus also hosts the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, a world class research centre devoted to the understanding of human language and communication.

Featured prominently on the northwest side of the university's Heyendaal campus is the Heyendaal castle. It borders the Radboud University Medical Center, a large teaching hospital located on the campus, which is linked to the university's medical department. Bordering the university hospital is the Huygens Building, which houses the Faculty of Natural Sciences. At the south end of the campus next to the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC), one finds the Erasmus Tower which houses the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, Theology and Religion. The Erasmus Tower and the RSC border the Elinor Ostrom building, which is home to the School of Management and also encompasses the political sciences and economics faculty staff. On the other side of the Erasmus Tower, a number of general lecture halls is located along with the campus pub and bookshop. Beyond this area, in the southwest of the campus, one finds the modern Maria Montessori building, home to the Faculty of Social Sciences, and the Grotius building, home to the Faculty of Law. In the most southern part of the campus, the monumental Jesuit Berchmanianum monastery can be found which houses the university's general services staff and will serve as its auditorium

In 2017, a SPAR minimarket was opened in the Erasmus building which provides students with snacks and accessories. The university campus borders the campus of the HAN vocational university, which in turn is located next to Heyendaal train station. Frequent shuttle buses connect the university to Nijmegen Central Station and the city centre.

Radboud University  enrols over 22.000 students in about one hundred study programs (about 50 bachelor's and 50 master's programs).[9] As of April 2021, the university offers 34 international master's programs taught in English and several more taught in Dutch.[10] There are nine bachelor's programs taught fully in English: American Studies, Artificial Intelligence, Biology, Chemistry, Computing Science, International Economics & Business, International Business Administration, English Language and Culture, Philosophy, Politics and Society and Molecular Life Sciences. Communication and Information Studies, History, Psychology and Arts and Culture Studies offer English-language tracks. All other bachelors are in Dutch, although most of the required literature is in English. Some exams, papers and even classes may be in English as well, despite the programs being Dutch-taught. All master's programs have been internationally accredited by the Accreditation Organization of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).

All English-taught master's programmes are research-based programmes. They are taught within the Faculties of Arts, Law, Social Sciences, Medical Sciences, Sciences and Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies, besides the Interfaculty Research school and the Nijmegen School of Management.[11]

Radboud University is home to several research institutions, including the Business & Law Research Centre, Institute for Management Research, NanoLab Nijmegen, the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour and HFML-FELIX. Faculty members Anne Cutler (1999), Henk Barendregt (2002), Peter Hagoort (2005), Theo Rasing (2008), Heino Falcke (2011), Mike Jetten (2012), Ieke Moerdijk (2012), Mikhail Katsnelson (2013), Wilhelm Huck (2016) and Klaas Landsman (2022) won the Spinoza Prize. Visiting professor Sir Andre Geim and former PhD student Sir Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Radboud University has been named best broad university in the Netherlands for the past seven consecutive years.[17] The physics department is considered top tier. A recent accomplishment is its contribution to the first picture of a black hole.[18] The Faculty of Law is nationally unrivaled in its research in business and law,[19] and retains strong international ties with other prominent research institutions, such as Bologna, Nice and Oxford. The Faculty of Law's European Law School and Notarial Law departments are considered best in class in the Netherlands,[20][21] just as the Political Sciences, Sociology and Theology programmes in their respective fields.[17]

The Radboud Excellence Initiative was created with the dual purposes of attracting talents from every academic field to Radboud University while strengthening international bonds between universities worldwide. The initiative is a joint enterprise of both Radboud University and Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center. It provides two routes by which a researcher may come to Radboud University. Promising researchers who have completed their doctorate between two and eight years earlier at the time of nomination may be nominated for a fellowship whereas those researchers who are more established in their discipline may be nominated for a professorship.[22]

Radboud University offers students the opportunity to join various ethnic, cultural and political organizations, along with numerous honor societies, special interest groups and socially focused student societies.

(revival in 1973)

Lately study associations have overtaken part of the role that student associations like Carolus Magnus used to play. These study associations are related to individual degree programs and are open to international students as well. Study associations don't have initiation rituals and regularly meet for fun-related, as well as study-related activities. Some examples of study associations are the study association for computing science and information sciences students (Thalia), the study association for history students (Excalibur), the study association for psychology students (SPIN), and the study association for Business Administration students (Synergy).

Radboud University's independent university media platform, Vox, intended for students and staff, publishes daily material online and delivers hard copy magazines every month. Its paper magazine is distributed on campus for free. Students at Radboud University also produce an independent student magazine that appears seven times a year: the Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad (ANS).

Radboud University offers many facilities for sports at the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC) a part of campus where students are welcomed 7 days a week to partake in a variety of at least 80 different sports. In addition to the facilities of the Radboud Sports Centre, Radboud University also boasts more than 35 student sports associations such as the Radboud Rangers (baseball), Obelix (rugby), Apelliotes (hockey), FC Kunde (soccer), Phocas (rowing) and De Loefbijter (sailing).

lately study associations have overtaken part of the role that student associations like carolus magnus used to play. these study associations are related to individual degree programs and are open to international students as well. study associations don't have initiation rituals and regularly meet for fun-related, as well as study-related activities. some examples of study associations are the study association for computing science and information sciences students (thalia), the study association for history students (excalibur), the study association for psychology students (spin), and the study association for business administration students (synergy).

radboud university's independent university media platform, vox, intended for students and staff, publishes daily material online and delivers hard copy magazines every month. its paper magazine is distributed on campus for free. students at radboud university also produce an independent student magazine that appears seven times a year: the algemeen nijmeegs studentenblad (ans).

 Radboud University 's coat of arm be design at the time of the founding of the university by the goldsmith workshop of the Brom family in Utrecht . the low part represent the coat of arm of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands . the dove in the upper part of the coat of arm be the symbol of the Holy Spirit . the entire shield be surmount by the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire because Nijmegen be once home to frankish King Charlemagne . underneath the coat of arm one find the university 's motto "" in Dei Nomine feliciter"",[7 ] mean "" happily in the name of God "" . the coat of arm be use on most of the university 's official document , include the university 's bachelor , master and phd certificate . for 2023 a special version of the coat of arm be design to celebrate Radboud University 's 100 year anniversary . 

 the establishment of a university in the city of Nijmegen go far back . the first University of Nijmegen be found in 1655 as the Kwartierlijke Academie van Nijmegen . student develop their skill in the traditional field of theology , medicine and law . although the university have its success , the Kwartierlijke Academie terminate around 1680 . the university be unable to recover from successive outbreak of the plague and the french invasion of the Netherlands in 1672 . 

 after several attempt to establish a new university in Nijmegen , the current Radboud University Nijmegen be establish in 1923 under the name Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen ( Catholic University of Nijmegen ) . it be found by the Saint Radboud Foundation , a network of bishop that wish to emancipate catholic intellectual in the Netherlands . at the time , Dutch Roman Catholics be disadvantage and occupy almost no high post in governmental and scientific institution . the establishment of a university be see as a possible stepping stone for these individual . 

 when the Catholic University of Nijmegen be found , every student automatically become part of student corporation N.S.V. Carolus Magnus [ nl ] , name after the frankish king , Charlemagne , who use to reside in Nijmegen in the Middle Ages . this organization be set up to speak for   student need and to organize an annual induction ceremony . it also aim at attain the same status as other corporation in the well - know dutch student city of Leiden , Delft and Groningen . to the horror of the Catholic University 's management , Carolus Magnus also pursue the same liberal elitist character as these other corporation . still , it continue develop and student eagerly participate . in the 1920 it produce its own sociëteiten : male student become part of Gentleman 's Roland Society   ( 1928 ) and female student join the Ladies Society Lumen Ducet ( 1929 ) . some student of these sociëteiten band together in small community call disputen . 

 the first year after the establishment of 1923 be quite successful for the Catholic University of Nijmegen , but during the Second World War the young university encounter serious difficulty . many prominent member be lose , among they the anti - nazi professor Robert Regout and Titus Brandsma who   be deport to Dachau concentration camp and die there . as the war progress , the university be more severely curtail in its freedom . the german Sicherheitsdienst ( security service ) remove so - call "" anti - german work "" from the University library . in addition , professor could only be appoint after approval by the Nazi Department of Education , Science and Cultural Protection . such measure aim at eventually eliminate religious institution of high education . there would be no place for a catholic university in a nazified Netherlands . 

 in March and April 1943 , the conflict with the Nazi occupy force reach a boiling point . the occupier demand that all student in the Netherlands sign a declaration of loyalty . if they do not , they be not allow to continue their study and have to work in Germany as force laborer . however , student in Nijmegen show to be resistant to the german demand . at the risk of his own life , law student Jozef van Hövelleven launch a widespread campaign to get as many student as possible not to sign . 

 the university 's rector magnificus at that time , Bernard Hermesdorf , decide to show solidarity with student like Jozef van Hövell . as the only dutch rector in the Netherlands he refuse , for "" reason of principle "" , to distribute pre - printed loyalty statement to his student . although heroic , Hermesdorf 's refusal lead to extreme anger among the occupying Nazi force . on May 5 , 1943 , the Germans demand all Nijmegen 's non - signatory of the loyalty statement to report to Ommen within 24 hour to be put to work in Germany . if they do not , their family would be hold responsible . these circumstance leave rector magnificus Bernard Hermesdorf with no choice but to close the door of the university as of April 11 1943 , pende well time . eventually , only 83 student decide to report to the Germans in Ommen . Most of the student go into hiding , scatter across the Netherlands . the great spider in the web during that time be university moderator Bernard van Ogtrop , who travel all over the country to visit student from Nijmegen in hiding . he write circular , take care of a wide - range correspondence , and run a parcel service and thus manage to keep many people 's spirit up . the university be closed , but thank to Van Ogtrop it continue to exist , if only in the mind of the student . 

 when the war end in 1944 , the university infrastructure have be largely destroy , but student still return to their alma mater in drib and drab . class officially resume again in March 1945 , but because many university building have be bomb during the war , a dire need for new facility exist . with the purchase of the Heyendaal estate , the university get its own campus in a green setting less than a fifteen - minute bike ride from the Nijmegen city center . in 1951 , the Faculty of Medical Sciences be the first faculty to move to Heyendaal . soon , other faculty follow . by 1988 , all faculty have move to Heyendaal . the move to a new campus also with a rise in student attend the Catholic University of Nijmegen . since the end of the war , student number steadily rise from 3,000 in 1960 to 15,000 in 1980 . 

 the period between 1960 and 1975 be often generally describe as the "" Age of Student Unrest "" . not only do the student population in Nijmegen rise exponentially , it have also become more diverse , leave - lean and less elitist . next to that , the hippie movement have reach the city which cause many student to desire a more democratic student life . Umbrella organization Carolus Magnus become increasingly bloated and lose connection with the member of sociëteiten and disputen that begin to operate more independently . it be not the beloved corporation it use to be and student criticize the mandatory membership of Carolus Magnus . therefore , the organization slowly become more concerned with administrative duty than organize community activity . in 1966 Carolus Magnus cease to exist in its traditional sense . from that moment on , student be free to choose which association they join and which not . in the 1980 and 1990 many other kind of student association be establish in Nijmegen , include evangelical - christian association Navigators , egalitarian association Ovum Novum , and alternative student association Karpe Noktum . 

 as an indication of its evolve relationship with the Bishops ' Conference of the Netherlands and to appear less sectarian , the university 's executive council change the university 's name in 2004 to the Radboud University Nijmegen after Saint Radboud of Utrecht , a medieval bishop . tension continue between the university 's executive council and the bishop ' conference over the secularizing direction of the university . the repeat nomination of non - catholics and non - practice Catholics to the executive council , which the bishop ' conference would not approve , exacerbate tension . in response to a decision to open a Transgender Care Center at the university 's medical center , the bishop ' conference revoke the designation Catholic from the university in November 2020 . accordingly , the university lose its eligibility to receive church subsidy and its right to identify as roman Catholic . the university appeal to the Holy See , and in November 2022 the pope 's Dicastery for Culture and Education rule that the bishop ' conference could remove the designation "" catholic "" from the executive council but not from the university as a whole.[8 ]

maastricht.txt,maastricht.txt,"Maastricht University (abbreviated as UM;[5] Dutch: Universiteit Maastricht[6]) is a public research university in Maastricht, Netherlands. Founded in 1976, it is the second youngest of the thirteen Dutch universities.

In 2021, 22,383 students studied at Maastricht University, 56% of whom were foreign students, with over 4,000 employees.[3] About half of the bachelor's programmes are fully offered in English, while the other half is taught wholly or partly in Dutch. Most of the master's and doctoral programmes are in English. Besides traditional programmes, Maastricht University also has three honours liberal arts colleges: University College Maastricht and the Maastricht Science Programme in the same liberal arts tradition. The satellite University College Venlo opened in 2015.

Maastricht University regularly ranks as one of Europe's leading universities. The university has been placed in the top 300 universities in the world by five major ranking tables. Maastricht University was at 88th place in the Times Higher Education World Ranking in 2016 (127th as of 2021), and 4th among Young Universities (6th in 2021).[7] Amongst others, Maastricht University's master's programme in International Business is ranked 25, being in the top 25 of the best business programmes in the world according to the Financial Times[8][third-party source needed], and its law faculty is ranked in 3rd place within the European Union and 23rd worldwide by the Times Higher Education World Ranking for the 2021-2022 period.[9] In 2013, Maastricht University was the second Dutch university to be rewarded the 'Distinctive Quality Feature for Internationalisation' by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).

The University of Maastricht is one of the most important schools of political economy in the world.

Maastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of Limburg, most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the Labour Party and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the Limburg coal mining industry.[10]

The newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of problem-based learning. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the Dutch Parliament eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.[11] The new university, named Rijksuniversiteit Limburg (State University of Limburg), was officially established on 9 January 1976, when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the Basilica of Saint Servatius. Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.

Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The faculty of law was created in 1981, followed by the faculty of economics in 1984. In 1994, the faculty of arts and culture and one year later the faculty of psychology were established. The faculty of humanities and sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the department of knowledge engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance.  Together with the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.[12]

The university was renamed Universiteit Maastricht in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.

On December 23, 2019, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a Microsoft Windows ransomware attack using ""Clop"". The ransomware encrypted almost all Windows systems used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break.[13] A ransom was set from the offenders, which allowed a decryption of the university systems after Maastricht University paid €200,000 in a Bitcoin transfer. The lessons resumed with no delays on 6 January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members.[14]

In 2020, the public prosecutor service seized the cryptocurrency account in which the ransom was paid. Once the ransom was converted from Bitcoin to Euros, the University was able to recover €500.000, double of what was paid.[15]

Maastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.

The university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht's city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht's historic city centre.[16]

The first building that was obtained by the university was the former Jesuit monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the faculty of medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (mensa in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect Jo Coenen.

The Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as Oud Gouvernement in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river Meuse in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies Slijpe Court, a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.

The university's administrative headquarters is located at Minderbroedersberg, in a former Franciscan monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its Aula (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.

At the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the Bonnefanten, now the university's Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from Liège who were referred to as ""bons enfants"", ""good children"". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, Bonnefantenmuseum. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's poor house and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.

University College Maastricht is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century béguinage, named Nieuwenhof. Maastricht Science College has its new home since 2012 in the renovated Hustinx Mansion in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented façade and a courtyard that is now covered.

Since 2013, the university has acquired several buildings on the site of the former Tapijn barracks, adjacent to the city park (Stadspark). Although outside the medieval centre, the area is still part of the Jekerkwartier. In 2019 the main U-shaped buildings were refurbished and enlarged with an underground atrium. They now house UM Learning Spaces. Other buildings at the Tapijn Campus are used temporarily by Knowledge Engineering and to help start-up enterprises.

Several other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS) currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. Soiron Mansion, built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of Saint Servatius Church, the former Ursuline girls schools, and Tilly Court, built for the Count of Tilly, the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century.

The Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck. The Randwyck and Brightlands campuses are not to be confused with the failed Calatrava Campus, also in Randwyck, which in 2008 had to be abandoned after construction had already begun, because the cost spiraled out of control.

The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.

In 2019, UM bought an existing office blok in Paul-Henri Spaaklaan, which after refurbishment will house the Department of Knowledge Engineering.

In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of Venlo, the Belgian capital of Brussels and the city of Bangalore, India.

The Maastricht University, Campus Venlo is located in the renovated ""Raad van Arbeid"" building at Nassaustraat, close to the center of Venlo. Maastricht University currently offers two Master's programmes (Global Supply Chain Management, and Health Food Innovation Management) and a Bachelor's programme (University College Venlo) at this campus . Courses at University College Venlo started in September 2015.[17][third-party source needed]

At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. The Executive Board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities.[18] It is advised by the Supervisory Council that vets for instance the budget.
The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, has a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the university's teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.

Maastricht University's teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of faculties.[19] Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges. The names of organisational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university's organisational hierarchy. In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed school of business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.[20]

The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.[21]

The Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML) was established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine. The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the faculty of health sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in healthcare sciences, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.

The two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).

Founded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology. It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff.[22] The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor's programme in psychology, two English-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. The one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology. In conjunction with the faculty of health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and psychopathology. The selective two-year master programme Forensic Psychology in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure – including hypermodern high field MRI scanners – allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.

The School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984.[23] It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers. Of the 4,200 students enrolled, more than 60% come from abroad.[24] As a business school, SBE is accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and the Association of MBAs. According to the school's website, this Triple Crown accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide.[25][third-party source needed]
SBE offers bachelor's programmes (B.Sc.) in International Business, Business Engineering, Economics and Business Economics, Fiscal Economics, and Econometrics and Operations Research, as well as a number of master's programmes, executive master's programmes and MBA's. SBE students are represented by SCOPE Maastricht, the School's general student association.

Maastricht University's Faculty of Law (FL) was founded in 1981.[26] Times Higher Education (THE) ranks the university's Law programme at 40th in the world in 2020.[27] It started with a programme in Dutch law, designed in line with UM's problem-based learning principles. Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor's programme in law in the Netherlands.[26] The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. It offers four bachelor's (LL.B.) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, the Dutch-language ELS and the English-language ELS. In addition, the faculty offers seven master's (LL.M.) programmes and three advanced master's programmes, most of which are taught in English.

In research, the faculty's Graduate School of Law has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law.[28][third-party source needed] 
The faculty participates in two national research schools, the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, and is home to several research institutes: the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO), the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights, the Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht, the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI), and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI).

The faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof béguinage, currently home to University College Maastricht. With the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. This building, the former seat of the provincial government of Limburg, consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.

The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, also known as FASoS, was founded in 1994. Currently FASoS hosts approximately 2000 students and around 240 staff members. Over 70% of the students are non-Dutch. Research and education is internationally oriented and all of the programmes are offered in English. The faculty is located in the centre of Maastricht, in four buildings on the Grote Gracht.[29]

The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences offers two three-year bachelors programmes: Cultuurwetenschappen/Arts and Culture; and European Studies, and eight one-year masters programmes: European Studies; Globalisation and Development Studies; European Public Affairs; European Studies on Society, Science and Technology; Arts and Heritage; Policy, Management and Culture; Media Culture; Art, Literature and Society; and Politics and Society. Furthermore, two two-year research masters are offered: Cultures of Arts, Science and Technology; and European Studies.[30]

The Research Institute for Arts and Social Sciences encompasses all research of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The Research Institute comprises four programmes: 1. Politics and Culture in Europe, 2. Science, Technology and Society, 3. Cultural Memory and Diversity and 4. Globalisation, Transnationalism and Development. The research area overlaps both the humanities and the social sciences. The faculty has a graduate school with an intake of about 10 PhD candidates each year.[31]

The Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE), formerly the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, consists of:

Tuition fees at Maastricht University vary, depending on nationality and study programme. Regular tuition fees for public universities in the Netherlands are determined annually by law. Statutory tuition fees currently amount to €2,060 annually for both bachelor's and master's programmes.[32] Under European regulations, regular tuition levels are also applicable to foreign students from the European Economic Area, which includes all European Union member states. All other students pay institutional tuition fees, ranging from €7,500 to €10,000 annually for bachelor's programmes and €13,000 or more annually for master's programmes. Since 2012, students at the University College pay a surcharge on top of the statutory or institutional tuition fees[32] to fund additional facilities, a student grants programme and student organisations at the college. An earlier plan to introduce a separate institutional fee at the University College was shelved after criticism from staff and students.[33]

Ph.D. candidates (promovendi) at Maastricht University do not pay tuition as they have the rank of junior members of the academic staff.[34] Ph.D. candidates are employed by the university or faculty on full-time, four-year contracts with regular, entry-level wages and employee benefits. Ph.D. appointments usually involve teaching responsibilities and limited administrative duties.

The Limburg University Fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the UM, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets.

Maastricht University's academic staff consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46. The number of support staff members amounts to 1,600, of which about 62% is female.[35] Nearly 20% of UM's staff members hold a foreign nationality.[35] In 2014 about 17% of professors at Maastricht University were women, which is more or less the average in the Netherlands.[36]

Maastricht University awards degrees at all levels up to the title of doctor.

Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of problem-based learning (PBL). According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.[37][third-party source needed] In 1974, Maastricht's newly established faculty of medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.

At the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.[37] A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.[38] A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor',[39] plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.

Even though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.[40]

According to Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2016, Maastricht University occupied 88th (121st as of 2021) position in the world ranking.[48]
QS World University Rankings 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while Academic Ranking of World Universities (or Shanghai Ranking) counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.

In the QS Top 50 Under 50, which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 19th place in 2021.[44]

In a similar list published by THE (THE 100 Under 50 universities 2021), Maastricht University was placed at the 6th in the world.[46]

In terms of specific areas of studies, THE[27] ranks Maastricht University at 23rd in the field of ""Law,"" 64th in ""Clinical & health"" and 72nd in ""Business & Economics"" in the world for 2022. The Financial Times places the school of business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.

The School of Business and Economics has been awarded the 'Triple accreditation' by the prestigious AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.

In addition to excellent medicine, business, and law programs, Maastricht University may perhaps be best known for the excellent reputation of its psychology department attracting students and researchers from across the world. Within the domain of biological psychology, Maastricht University is ranked 5th in the world.[49] Among its excellent facilities, Maastricht University has one of only 5 fully operational Tesla 9.4 MRI scanners found worldwide allowing for ground breaking research in fields of psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience.[50] Furthermore, Maastricht University is also ranked 5th in the world in fields of education and educational research.[51]

Research at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World. Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the European integration process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.

A noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk moved to Maastricht University in February 2014. His presence fits in the large investment programme Kennis-As Limburg, that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. So does the Institute of Nanoscopy, led by Professor Peter Peters.

In 2011 the number of dissertations at the University of Maastricht had reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567.[52] Most PhD programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called graduate schools) or associated institutes.[53]

As elsewhere, ongoing research at Maastricht University is translated into practice, leading to new products to be launched on the market. UM cooperates with businesses and socially relevant organisations through various programmes and institutes, like the Maastricht Centre for Entrepreneurship, Service Science Factory, BioMedbooster, BioPartner Center Maastricht, Contract Research Centre and SME Portal Maastricht University. UM Holding is the corporate venture firm of UM spin-off companies and participations.

Brainport 2020 is the name of a programme that aims at campus development in four locations in the province of Limburg, in cooperation with the local government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region:

In 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at Maastricht University, 47% of whom were foreign.  Students in Maastricht can affiliate with a number of student associations, international associations or debating societies. They present themselves during the annual INKOM, the general introduction week for new Maastricht students. Furthermore, Maastricht offers several cultural and sports activities in and around the city.

Like most other Dutch universities, UM itself does not provide regular student housing. However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students. About 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the Maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations Woonpunt, Servatius and Maasvallei. Some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords.[54] Most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods. Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.

UM's Student Service Centre is located in the former Bonnefanten monastery and offers financial, legal and other forms of advise to students. Part of the Student Service Centre is the Studium Generale cultural programma, offering lectures on a broad range of topics and other cultural activities to members of the university community and the general public.[55]

The university's independent newspaper, Observant, is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university. It provides news, background articles, columns and educational information in Dutch and English, directed primarily at the university community.[56][third-party source needed]

Since 2012 a television programme named BreakingMaas provides news and entertainment for students in English. The programme is available on the local TV broadcaster RTV Maastricht as well as on YouTube and Facebook.

maastricht university regularly ranks as one of europe's leading universities. the university has been placed in the top 300 universities in the world by five major ranking tables. maastricht university was at 88th place in the times higher education world ranking in 2016 (127th as of 2021), and 4th among young universities (6th in 2021).[7] amongst others, maastricht university's master's programme in international business is ranked 25, being in the top 25 of the best business programmes in the world according to the financial times[8][third-party source needed], and its law faculty is ranked in 3rd place within the european union and 23rd worldwide by the times higher education world ranking for the 2021-2022 period.[9] in 2013, maastricht university was the second dutch university to be rewarded the 'distinctive quality feature for internationalisation' by the accreditation organisation of the netherlands and flanders (nvao).

the university of maastricht is one of the most important schools of political economy in the world.

maastricht university was officially established in 1976. faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. political leaders in the province of limburg, most notably sjeng tans, the chairman of the labour party and former member of the limburg provincial council and maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in maastricht. this academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the limburg coal mining industry.[10]

the newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in september 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of problem-based learning. about 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. by the end of 1975, the dutch parliament eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.[11] the new university, named rijksuniversiteit limburg (state university of limburg), was officially established on 9 january 1976, when queen juliana of the netherlands signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the basilica of saint servatius. sjeng tans became the university's first president.

soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. the faculty of law was created in 1981, followed by the faculty of economics in 1984. in 1994, the faculty of arts and culture and one year later the faculty of psychology were established. the faculty of humanities and sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the department of knowledge engineering and the maastricht graduate school of governance.  together with the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine) maastricht university currently has six faculties.[12]

the university was renamed universiteit maastricht in 1996 and added its english-language name in 2008. as of 2010, maastricht university consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several ph.d. programmes.

on december 23, 2019, maastricht university suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a microsoft windows ransomware attack using ""clop"". the ransomware encrypted almost all windows systems used by maastricht university, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the christmas break.[13] a ransom was set from the offenders, which allowed a decryption of the university systems after maastricht university paid €200,000 in a bitcoin transfer. the lessons resumed with no delays on 6 january, with most online services again available to both students and staff members.[14]

in 2020, the public prosecutor service seized the cryptocurrency account in which the ransom was paid. once the ransom was converted from bitcoin to euros, the university was able to recover €500.000, double of what was paid.[15]

maastricht university is located in buildings in two separate locations in maastricht. the arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.

the university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in maastricht's city centre, west of the river meuse. most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. as many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of maastricht's historic city centre.[16]

the first building that was obtained by the university was the former jesuit monastery and seminary at tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. after the faculty of medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the jesuit monastery became home to the faculty of economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. the building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (mensa in dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by dutch architect jo coenen.

the faculty of law is housed in the building known as oud gouvernement in bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. it was acquired by the um in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river meuse in the southeastern part of the city. opposite lies slijpe court, a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the department of knowledge engineering of the faculty of humanities and science.

the university's administrative headquarters is located at minderbroedersberg, in a former franciscan monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. the um acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. the minderbroedersberg, with its aula (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as ph.d. conferrals.

at the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the bonnefanten, now the university's student service center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. this building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from liège who were referred to as ""bons enfants"", ""good children"". in the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, bonnefantenmuseum. in 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. the oldest part of the library building at grote looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's poor house and military hospital. in the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. in 1999 the city library moved to its current location at centre ceramique. the old library was then acquired by the um. after major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.

university college maastricht is located at zwingelput in a 15th-century béguinage, named nieuwenhof. maastricht science college has its new home since 2012 in the renovated hustinx mansion in kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented façade and a courtyard that is now covered.

since 2013, the university has acquired several buildings on the site of the former tapijn barracks, adjacent to the city park (stadspark). although outside the medieval centre, the area is still part of the jekerkwartier. in 2019 the main u-shaped buildings were refurbished and enlarged with an underground atrium. they now house um learning spaces. other buildings at the tapijn campus are used temporarily by knowledge engineering and to help start-up enterprises.

several other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. the um language centre is based in an old canon's house at sint servaasklooster. the faculty of arts and social sciences (fasos) currently occupies three adjacent buildings on grote gracht. soiron mansion, built by the architect matthias soiron for his two brothers, canons of saint servatius church, the former ursuline girls schools, and tilly court, built for the count of tilly, the military governor of maastricht, both date from the 18th century.

the randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. here, plans for the brightlands maastricht health campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of randwyck. the randwyck and brightlands campuses are not to be confused with the failed calatrava campus, also in randwyck, which in 2008 had to be abandoned after construction had already begun, because the cost spiraled out of control.

the focal point for the randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azm), which moved here from its original location on the west bank of the meuse river in 1992. some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. the university and the azm work together in the maastricht university medical center+, established in 2008.

in 2019, um bought an existing office blok in paul-henri spaaklaan, which after refurbishment will house the department of knowledge engineering.

in recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern limburg city of venlo, the belgian capital of brussels and the city of bangalore, india.

the maastricht university, campus venlo is located in the renovated ""raad van arbeid"" building at nassaustraat, close to the center of venlo. maastricht university currently offers two master's programmes (global supply chain management, and health food innovation management) and a bachelor's programme (university college venlo) at this campus . courses at university college venlo started in september 2015.[17][third-party source needed]

at the central level, the university is governed by the executive board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. the executive board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities.[18] it is advised by the supervisory council that vets for instance the budget.
the university council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, has a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the university's teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.

maastricht university's teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of faculties.[19] within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges. the names of organisational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university's organisational hierarchy. in 2009, for example, the faculty of economics and business administration was renamed school of business and economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.[20]

the board of deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.[21]

the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences (fhml) was established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine. the latter was the first faculty to be established at maastricht university. in 1980 the faculty of health sciences was founded. the broad range of disciplines it offered in healthcare sciences, made the faculty unique, not only in the netherlands, but also in europe. the format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. a one-year master's program in global health is available.

the two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). since 1992 staff and students are based in the randwyck district, near the university hospital (academisch ziekenhuis maastricht or azm) which opened in 1991. the azm has been renamed mumc+ (maastrichts universitair medisch centrum plus).

founded in 1995, the faculty of psychology and neuroscience (fpn) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology. it is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff.[22] the faculty offers a dutch and english bachelor's programme in psychology, two english-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. the one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology. in conjunction with the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences, the two-year research master cognitive and clinical neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and psychopathology. the selective two-year master programme forensic psychology in english, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. the faculty's unique research infrastructure – including hypermodern high field mri scanners – allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.

the school of business and economics (sbe) was founded in 1984.[23] it is currently the biggest faculty within um in terms of student numbers. of the 4,200 students enrolled, more than 60% come from abroad.[24] as a business school, sbe is accredited by equis, aacsb and the association of mbas. according to the school's website, this triple crown accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide.[25][third-party source needed]
sbe offers bachelor's programmes (b.sc.) in international business, business engineering, economics and business economics, fiscal economics, and econometrics and operations research, as well as a number of master's programmes, executive master's programmes and mba's. sbe students are represented by scope maastricht, the school's general student association.

maastricht university's faculty of law (fl) was founded in 1981.[26] times higher education (the) ranks the university's law programme at 40th in the world in 2020.[27] it started with a programme in dutch law, designed in line with um's problem-based learning principles. ninety students enrolled in the first year. in the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the european law school (els), which focused on european, comparative and international law. the programme was taught partly in english. a fully english-language els programme was established in 2007. it was the first english-language bachelor's programme in law in the netherlands.[26] the faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. it offers four bachelor's (ll.b.) programmes: dutch law, tax law, the dutch-language els and the english-language els. in addition, the faculty offers seven master's (ll.m.) programmes and three advanced master's programmes, most of which are taught in english.

in research, the faculty's graduate school of law has built a reputation in the areas of international, european and comparative law.[28][third-party source needed] 
the faculty participates in two national research schools, the school of human rights and the ius commune research school, and is home to several research institutes: the institute for transnational legal research (metro), the maastricht centre for human rights, the institute for globalisation and international regulation (igir), the montesquieu institute maastricht, the institute for corporate law, governance and innovation policies (icgi), and the maastricht european private law institute (m-epli).

the faculty was initially located at the nieuwenhof béguinage, currently home to university college maastricht. with the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. this building, the former seat of the provincial government of limburg, consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. the building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.

the faculty of arts and social sciences, also known as fasos, was founded in 1994. currently fasos hosts approximately 2000 students and around 240 staff members. over 70% of the students are non-dutch. research and education is internationally oriented and all of the programmes are offered in english. the faculty is located in the centre of maastricht, in four buildings on the grote gracht.[29]

the faculty of arts and social sciences offers two three-year bachelors programmes: cultuurwetenschappen/arts and culture; and european studies, and eight one-year masters programmes: european studies; globalisation and development studies; european public affairs; european studies on society, science and technology; arts and heritage; policy, management and culture; media culture; art, literature and society; and politics and society. furthermore, two two-year research masters are offered: cultures of arts, science and technology; and european studies.[30]

the research institute for arts and social sciences encompasses all research of the faculty of arts and social sciences. the research institute comprises four programmes: 1. politics and culture in europe, 2. science, technology and society, 3. cultural memory and diversity and 4. globalisation, transnationalism and development. the research area overlaps both the humanities and the social sciences. the faculty has a graduate school with an intake of about 10 phd candidates each year.[31]

the faculty of science and engineering (fse), formerly the faculty of humanities and sciences, consists of:

the limburg university fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the um, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets.

maastricht university's academic staff consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46. the number of support staff members amounts to 1,600, of which about 62% is female.[35] nearly 20% of um's staff members hold a foreign nationality.[35] in 2014 about 17% of professors at maastricht university were women, which is more or less the average in the netherlands.[36]

maastricht university awards degrees at all levels up to the title of doctor.

teaching at maastricht university is founded on the educational principles of problem-based learning (pbl). according to its website, um is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.[37][third-party source needed] in 1974, maastricht's newly established faculty of medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. as pbl was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a pbl approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.

qs world university rankings 2017/18 ranked maastricht university as the 200th best university in the world, while academic ranking of world universities (or shanghai ranking) counted maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.

in the qs top 50 under 50, which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, um reached the 19th place in 2021.[44]

in a similar list published by the (the 100 under 50 universities 2021), maastricht university was placed at the 6th in the world.[46]

in terms of specific areas of studies, the[27] ranks maastricht university at 23rd in the field of ""law,"" 64th in ""clinical & health"" and 72nd in ""business & economics"" in the world for 2022. the financial times places the school of business and economics at the 60th place in 2016.

the school of business and economics has been awarded the 'triple accreditation' by the prestigious aacsb, equis and amba.

a noted research platform is scannexus (formerly known as: brains unlimited): a scanning lab at the brightlands maastricht health campus, offering three mri scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 tesla scanners worldwide. professor rainer goebel, director of the affiliated maastricht brain imaging centre (m-bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. the internationally renowned tissue regeneration group of professor clemens van blitterswijk moved to maastricht university in february 2014. his presence fits in the large investment programme kennis-as limburg, that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. so does the institute of nanoscopy, led by professor peter peters.

in 2011 the number of dissertations at the university of maastricht had reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567.[52] most phd programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called graduate schools) or associated institutes.[53]

as elsewhere, ongoing research at maastricht university is translated into practice, leading to new products to be launched on the market. um cooperates with businesses and socially relevant organisations through various programmes and institutes, like the maastricht centre for entrepreneurship, service science factory, biomedbooster, biopartner center maastricht, contract research centre and sme portal maastricht university. um holding is the corporate venture firm of um spin-off companies and participations.

brainport 2020 is the name of a programme that aims at campus development in four locations in the province of limburg, in cooperation with the local government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region:

in 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at maastricht university, 47% of whom were foreign.  students in maastricht can affiliate with a number of student associations, international associations or debating societies. they present themselves during the annual inkom, the general introduction week for new maastricht students. furthermore, maastricht offers several cultural and sports activities in and around the city.

like most other dutch universities, um itself does not provide regular student housing. however, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students. about 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations woonpunt, servatius and maasvallei. some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords.[54] most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods. many foreign exchange students live at the um guesthouse in annadal, which provides short-term housing.

um's student service centre is located in the former bonnefanten monastery and offers financial, legal and other forms of advise to students. part of the student service centre is the studium generale cultural programma, offering lectures on a broad range of topics and other cultural activities to members of the university community and the general public.[55]

the university's independent newspaper, observant, is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university. it provides news, background articles, columns and educational information in dutch and english, directed primarily at the university community.[56][third-party source needed]

since 2012 a television programme named breakingmaas provides news and entertainment for students in english. the programme is available on the local tv broadcaster rtv maastricht as well as on youtube and facebook.

Utrecht University (UU; Dutch: Universiteit Utrecht, formerly Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht) is a public research university in Utrecht, Netherlands. Established 26 March 1636 (387 years ago) (1636-03-26), it is one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands. In 2022, it had an enrollment of 37,675 students, and employed 8,584 faculty members and staff.[2] More than 400 PhD degrees were awarded and 8,500 scientific articles were published. The university's 2022 budget was €2.606 billion, consisting of €1.067 billion for the university[2] and €1.539 billion for the University Medical College Utrecht.[4]

The university's interdisciplinary research targets life sciences, pathways to sustainability, dynamics of youth, and institutions for open societies. Its teaching and research are strongly connected where equality, diversity, and inclusion are valued.
Utrecht University counts a number of distinguished scholars among its alumni and faculty, including 12 Nobel Prize laureates, 19 Spinoza Prize and 2 NWO Stevin Prize laureates. Utrecht University is led by the University Board, consisting of Henk Kummeling (Rector Magnificus), Anton Pijpers (chair), Margot van der Starre (Vice Chair) and Anneloes Krul (Student Assessor).

Close ties are harboured with other institutions internationally through its membership in the Coimbra Group (CG), the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Utrecht Network and the European University Association (EUA).

Utrecht University was founded on 26 March 1636.[5] It has its roots in the Illustrious School of Utrecht, which founded two years earlier in 1634 before being elevated to the status of university in 1636. The influential professor of theology Gisbertus Voetius delivered the inaugural speech, and Bernardus Schotanus (professor of law and mathematics) became the university's first rector magnificus. Anna Maria van Schurman, who became the university's first female student, was invited to write a Latin poem for the inauguration.[6] Initially, only a few dozen students attended classes at the university. Seven professors worked in four faculties: philosophy, which offered all students an introductory education, and three higher-level faculties (theology, medicine and law).

Utrecht University flourished in the seventeenth century, and contributed significantly to the Dutch Golden Age, despite competition with the older universities, such as Leiden (1575) and Groningen (1614). Leiden, in particular, proved a strong competitor and made further improvement necessary; a rivalry that persists to this day. A botanical garden was built on the grounds of the present Sonnenborgh Observatory, and three years later the Smeetoren added an astronomical observatory. The university attracted many students from abroad (especially from Germany, England and Scotland). They witnessed the intellectual and theological battle fought between proponents of the new philosophy (René Descartes lived for a few years in Utrecht) and proponents of the strict Reformed theologian Voetius. They also witnessed the teachings of renowned Dutch jurist, Johannes Voet, a university alumnus and professor of law, whose works remain highly authoritative in modern Roman-Dutch law.

In 1806, the French occupying authorities of the Netherlands downgraded Utrecht University to an école secondaire (high school), but after the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 it regained its former status.[5] Leiden, Leuven, Groningen, Utrecht and Ghent were the five universities (Dutch: hoge scholen) of the new state. Two of the universities (Leuven and Ghent) became part of the new Belgian state after their respective provinces separated from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830. As a result, Utrecht University remained one of only three Dutch universities. During the French occupation, King Louis Napoleon ordered the construction of a palace in the centre of Utrecht, which eventually became the University Library City Centre.[5]

Utrecht University played a prominent role in the golden age of Dutch science. Around 1850 the ""Utrechtian School"" of science formed, with Pieter Harting, Gerardus J. Mulder, Christophorus H. D. Buys Ballot and Franciscus Donders among the leading scientists. They introduced the educational laboratory (onderwijslaboratorium) as a practical learning place for their students. The National Veterinary School (Dutch:Rijks Veeartsenijschool) became Utrecht University's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1918.

As the university grew, the academic buildings in the historic city centre were unable to meet the university's increasing need for space. Therefore, starting from the 1960s, a significant part of the university moved to the De Uithof campus, which occupies the easternmost part of the city and is located south of De Bilt. However, the university continued to retain its academic buildings and presence in the historic city centre.

The university is represented in the Stichting Academisch Erfgoed, a foundation with the goal of preserving the university's heritage and collections.



The university consists of seven faculties, which offer 58 undergraduate degree programmes and over 150 graduate programmes.[7]

There are also three interfaculty units:

The two large faculties of Humanities and Law & Governance are situated in the inner city of Utrecht. The other five faculties and most of the administrative services are located in Utrecht Science Park De Uithof, a campus area on the outskirts of the city. University College Utrecht, along with the Utrecht School of Economics, are situated in the former Kromhout Kazerne, which used to be a Dutch military base. University College Roosevelt is located off-campus in the city of Middelburg in the south-west of the Netherlands.

On the 2023 AWRU list, the University of Utrecht was ranked 52nd globally and the highest in the Netherlands. Its ranking has declined slightly since 2003, when it was ranked 40th.

tilburg.txt,tilburg.txt,"Tilburg University is a public research university specializing in the social and behavioral sciences, economics, law, business sciences, theology and humanities, located in Tilburg in the southern part of the Netherlands.

Tilburg University has a student population of about 19,900 students.[3] Tilburg University has 73 Bachelors & Master's programs, of which 43 are offered in English.[3] Tilburg University awards approximately 120 PhDs per year.[4] In 2022, the university had 87,477 alumni.[3]

The university has a little over 2,200 FTE staff members, of which 57% are academic staff.[5]

The institution has gained a reputation in both research and education. In the field of economics, RePEc in March 2020 ranked the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration as the 23rd most productive research department in the world, and the 6th in Europe.[6] According to the 2019 Shanghai Ranking, Tilburg University is ranked 5th in the field of Business Administration and 12th in the field of Finance worldwide.[7][8] In the field of Law, Tilburg University was ranked #1 in the Netherlands for the last three years[when?] according to Elsevier Magazine.[9]

Wageningen University & Research (also known as Wageningen UR; abbreviation: WUR) is a public research university in Wageningen, Netherlands, specializing in life sciences with a focus on agriculture, technical and engineering subjects. It is a globally important center for life sciences and agricultural research. It is located in a region of the Netherlands known as the Food Valley.

WUR consists of Wageningen University and the former agricultural research institutes of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture. Wageningen University, as a research university, grants degrees at the BSc, MSc and PhD level in life and social sciences. It focuses its research on scientific, social and commercial problems in the field of life sciences and natural resources. It is widely known for its agriculture, forestry, and environmental studies programs. The university has about 12,000 students from over 100 countries. It is a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network.

In 1876 the Rijkslandbouwschool (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).

In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool (National Agricultural College). The opening date and official start date is 9 March 1918.

In 1986 the ""hogescholen"" (comparable to scientific institute of technology) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW) (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name hogeschool in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science.

Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general, while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes (Dienst Landbouwkundig Onderzoek / Service of agricultural research) merged with the university, the new organisation was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the university being renamed Wageningen University. Under Dutch laws the university and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.

In 2006, the university of applied sciences Van Hall Larenstein became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures, the collaboration remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to Velp.

In 2009 it was decided that the university would consistently use the English name in its communication, and that university research could be presented under the name of the university: Wageningen University (WU), next to the alternative use of the name Wageningen University and Research.[2][3] On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes became one joint brand: Wageningen University & Research (WUR).

On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University celebrated her 100 years anniversary. During this year there were many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen.

Wageningen University was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the European Commission and guarantees the quality of the study program. The university consequently applies this system, thus promoting the mobility of students within Europe and preventing study delay.

The university offers 19 BSc programs[4] (2018-2019). For some BSc programs, the language of instruction is English. Other programs teach in both Dutch and English. The programs start each year in September, last three years, and consist of 180 ECTS credits. The programs are in the field of economy and society, health, life sciences and technology, nature and environment, animals and plants.

Wageningen University offers 36 different MSc programs[5] (2017-2018) and two online masters programs.[6] Although formally the same MSc program, from 2022 onwards the Master of Management Economic and Consumer studies program was offered as 5 independent MSc tracks (Sustainable Business Innovations, Sustainable Supply Chain Analytics, Consumer Studies, Economics of Sustainability, Governance of Sustainability Transformations)[7] The language of instruction for all Master's programs is English. The programs start each year in September, they last two years, and consist of 120 ECTS credits. Most programs offer various specializations and possibilities for majors, as well as full or partial premaster tracks for candidates not fulfilling all entry requirements.

The regular PhD program is a four-year program during which PhD candidates are appointed as junior researcher in the universities, building up unemployment and retirement benefits. Such fully paid PhD candidates on a four year contract can be asked to perform teaching tasks for a maximum of 10% of their time as part of their appointment. Candidates supported by specific grants (usually bestowed upon the candidate by a (international) organisation), or doing PhD next to a regular job can also enrol. In these cases a tailored timeline will be agreed upon. The program consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component (30 ECTS or half a year of course load with conference presentations, and some management and teaching tasks can be listed as learning activity).  [8]

The following research institutes are part of Wageningen Research:

Wageningen University and Research has come under fire due to claims of partiality in research.[21][22] One case regards a research concerning bee colony collapse disorder.[23] Research conducted by Tjeerd Blacquière on the topic has caused controversy due to funding received for the research from the German pesticide producer Bayer,[23] the world's biggest producer of neonicotinoid insecticides, a suspect factor for the colony collapse disorder.[24][25]

In 2018 the Dutch magazine OneWorld went to court in an attempt to demand access to contracts between WUR and Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto, but OneWorld ultimately lost the court case.[26]

In the field of life sciences, agricultural and environmental science, the university is considered world-class.[38][39][40] According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings it is the best university in the Netherlands and No. 1 worldwide, in agriculture and forestry for 2017 on the QS World University Rankings charts.[41]

[ 8 ] 

 the follow research institute be part of Wageningen Research : 

 Wageningen University and Research have come under fire due to claim of partiality in research.[21][22 ] one case regard a research concern bee colony collapse disorder.[23 ] Research conduct by Tjeerd Blacquière on the topic have cause controversy due to funding receive for the research from the german pesticide producer bayer,[23 ] the world 's big producer of neonicotinoid insecticide , a suspect factor for the colony collapse disorder.[24][25 ] 

 in 2018 the dutch magazine OneWorld go to court in an attempt to demand access to contract between WUR and Bayer , Syngenta and Monsanto , but OneWorld ultimately lose the court case.[26 ]

leiden.txt,leiden.txt,"Leiden University (abbreviated as LEI;[4][5] Dutch: Universiteit Leiden) is a public research university in Leiden, Netherlands. It was founded as a Protestant university in 1575[6] by William, Prince of Orange, making it the oldest institution of higher education in the Netherlands.

Known for its historic foundations and emphasis on the social sciences, the university came into particular prominence during the Dutch Golden Age, when scholars from around Europe were attracted to the Dutch Republic due to its climate of intellectual tolerance. During this time, Leiden became the home to individuals such as René Descartes, Rembrandt, Christiaan Huygens, Hugo Grotius, Baruch Spinoza, and Baron d'Holbach.

The university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments, housing more than forty national and international research institutes. Its historical primary campus consists of buildings in multiple places in the college town of Leiden, while a second campus located in The Hague houses a liberal arts college (Leiden University College The Hague) and several of its faculties. It is a member of the Coimbra Group, the Europaeum, and a founding member of the League of European Research Universities.

The university has produced twenty-six Spinoza Prize Laureates and sixteen Nobel Laureates. Members of the Dutch royal family such as Queen Juliana, Queen Beatrix, and King Willem-Alexander are alumni, and ten prime ministers of the Netherlands including incumbent Mark Rutte. US President John Quincy Adams also studied at the university.[7]

In 1575, the emerging Dutch Republic did not have universities in its northern heartland. The only other university in the Habsburg Netherlands was the University of Leuven located in an area under firm Spanish control. Prince William founded Leiden University to give the Northern Netherlands an institution that could educate its citizens in religion and provide the government with educated men in all fields.[8][9] It is said the choice fell on Leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of Leiden against Spanish attacks in 1574. The name of Philip II of Spain, William's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate as he was still the de jure count of Holland.[10] Philip II forbade all his subjects to study in Leiden.

The new institution was initially located in the Convent of Saint Barbara, then moved to the Faliede Bagijn Church in 1577 (now the location of the university museum) and in 1581 to a former convent of Cistercian nuns, a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed by a fire in 1616.[8]

Leiden University's reputation was created in part by the presence of scholars such as Justus Lipsius, Joseph Scaliger, Franciscus Gomarus, Hugo Grotius, Jacobus Arminius, Daniel Heinsius, and Gerhard Johann Vossius within fifty years of its founding. By the 1640s, over five hundred students were enrolled from all across Europe, making it the largest Protestant university.[11][9] Baruch Spinoza discovered Descartes's work partly at Leiden University,[12] which he visited for periods of study multiple times.[13] In the 18th century, Jacobus Gronovius, Herman Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, and David Ruhnken were among the renowned academics of the university.

In 1896, the Zeeman effect was discovered at the institution by Pieter Zeeman and shortly afterward explained by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.[14] In the world's first university low-temperature laboratory, Professor Heike Kamerlingh Onnes achieved a temperature only one degree above absolute zero. In 1908, he was also the first to succeed in liquifying helium and has played a role in the discovery of superconductivity in metals.[15]

The University Library has more than 5.2 million books and fifty thousand journals. It also has collections of Western and Oriental manuscripts, printed books, archives, prints, drawings, photographs, maps, and atlases. It houses the world's largest collections on Indonesia and the Caribbean, collected by the Scaliger Institute which studies various aspects of knowledge transmissions and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day. In 2005, the manuscript of Einstein on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.[16]

In 2012 Leiden entered into a strategic alliance with Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Rotterdam for the universities to increase the quality of their research and teaching. The university is also the unofficial home of the Bilderberg Group, a meeting of high-level political and economic figures from North America and Europe. Leiden University partnered with Duke University School of Law starting in 2017 to run a joint summer program on global and transnational law from its Hague campus.

The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city. Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while Van Steenis, Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern.[17]

Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The KITLV or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the Leiden Observatory 1633; the Natural History Museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities), with especially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was Philipp Franz von Siebold's Japanese collections. The anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.[citation needed]

The Hortus Botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th-century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese Siebold Memorial Museum symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world-class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.[citation needed]

In 1998, the university has expanded to The Hague which has become home to Campus The Hague, with six of the seven faculties represented and exclusive home to the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, International Studies and Leiden University College The Hague, a liberal arts and sciences college. Here, the university offers academic courses in the fields of law, political science, public administration and medicine. It occupied a number of buildings in the centre of the city, including a college building at Lange Voorhout, before moving into the new 'Wijnhaven' building on Turfmarkt in 2016.

The Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs was established in 2011, together with the University College, and one of the largest programmes of the Faculty of Humanities, International Studies.

Since 2017 Leiden University Medical Center also has a branch at Campus The Hague.

The university is divided into seven major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programmes and over 100 graduate programmes.

Most of the university's departments offer their degree programme(s). Undergraduate programmes lead to either a B.A., B.Sc., or LL.B. degree. Other degrees, such as the B.Eng. or B.F.A., are not awarded at Leiden University.

Students can choose from a range of graduate programmes. Most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. Leiden University offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either MA, MSc, MPhil, or LLM degrees. The MPhil is the most advanced graduate degree and is awarded by select university departments (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archeology, Philosophy, and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career or before going into law or medicine. Traditionally, the MPhil degree enabled its holder to teach at the university levels as an associate professor.

In addition, most departments, affiliated (research) institutes, or faculties offer doctorate programmes or positions, leading to the Ph.D. degree. Most of the Ph.D. programmes offered by the university are concentrated in several research schools or institutes.

Leiden University has more than 50 research and graduate schools and institutes. Some of them are fully affiliated with one faculty of the university, while others are interfaculty institutes or interuniversity institutes.

Of the 107 Spinoza Prize laureates (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), twenty-six were granted to professors of Leiden University. Literary historian Frits van Oostrom was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award for his work on developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre. Other Spinoza Prize winners are linguists Frederik Kortlandt and Pieter Muysken, mathematician Hendrik Lenstra, physicists Carlo Beenakker, Jan Zaanen, Dirk Bouwmeester and Michel Orrit, astronomers Ewine van Dishoeck, Marijn Franx and Alexander Tielens, transplantation biologist Els Goulmy, clinical epidemiologist Frits Rosendaal, pedagogue Marinus van IJzendoorn, archeologists Wil Roebroeks and Corinne Hofman, neurologist Michel Ferrari, classicist Ineke Sluiter, social psychologist Naomi Ellemers, statistician Aad van der Vaart, cognitive psychologist Eveline Crone, organisation psychologist Carsten de Dreu, chemical immunologist Sjaak Neefjes, parasitologist Maria Yazdanbakhsh, electrochemist Mark Koper and astrophysicist Ignas Snellen.

The Stevin Prize laureates who have achieved exceptional success in knowledge exchange and impact for society include the following Leiden professors: health psychologist Andrea Evers, immunology technologist Ton Schumacher and psychologist Judi Mesman.[39] Among other leading professors are Wim Blockmans, professor of Medieval History, and Willem Adelaar, professor of Amerindian Languages.

Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. Three other professors received the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman received the Nobel Prize for their pioneering work in the field of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist Willem Einthoven for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of electrocardiography.

Nobel laureates associated with Leiden include the physicists Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Paul Ehrenfest. Also: Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Tobias Asser, Albert Szent-Györgyi, Igor Tamm, Jan Tinbergen, Nikolaas Tinbergen, Tjalling Koopmans, Nicolaas Bloembergen, and Niels Jerne.[40]

Other notable Leiden researchers were the Arabist and Islam expert Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, the law expert Cornelis van Vollenhoven and historian Johan Huizinga, all during the 1920s and 1930s. Martinus Beijerinck, one of the founders of virology, finished his Ph.D. at Leiden in 1877.","leiden university (abbreviated as lei;[4][5] dutch: universiteit leiden) is a public research university in leiden, netherlands. it was founded as a protestant university in 1575[6] by william, prince of orange, making it the oldest institution of higher education in the netherlands.

known for its historic foundations and emphasis on the social sciences, the university came into particular prominence during the dutch golden age, when scholars from around europe were attracted to the dutch republic due to its climate of intellectual tolerance. during this time, leiden became the home to individuals such as rené descartes, rembrandt, christiaan huygens, hugo grotius, baruch spinoza, and baron d'holbach.

the university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments, housing more than forty national and international research institutes. its historical primary campus consists of buildings in multiple places in the college town of leiden, while a second campus located in the hague houses a liberal arts college (leiden university college the hague) and several of its faculties. it is a member of the coimbra group, the europaeum, and a founding member of the league of european research universities.

the university has produced twenty-six spinoza prize laureates and sixteen nobel laureates. members of the dutch royal family such as queen juliana, queen beatrix, and king willem-alexander are alumni, and ten prime ministers of the netherlands including incumbent mark rutte. us president john quincy adams also studied at the university.[7]

in 1575, the emerging dutch republic did not have universities in its northern heartland. the only other university in the habsburg netherlands was the university of leuven located in an area under firm spanish control. prince william founded leiden university to give the northern netherlands an institution that could educate its citizens in religion and provide the government with educated men in all fields.[8][9] it is said the choice fell on leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of leiden against spanish attacks in 1574. the name of philip ii of spain, william's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate as he was still the de jure count of holland.[10] philip ii forbade all his subjects to study in leiden.

hanze.txt,hanze.txt,"Hanze University of Applied Sciences (abbreviated as: Hanze UAS; Dutch: Hanzehogeschool Groningen) is the largest vocational university in the northern Netherlands[1] and located in Groningen.

Hanze UAS offers various Bachelor and Master programmes in Dutch, English, and German, and works closely with international partner institutes. The school counts approximately 28,000 students and 3,200 employees. About, 8,1% of students are international.[2][3]

Hanze UAS was founded in 1986 as the merger of various local institutes for professional education, the oldest of which is the Academie Minerva, founded in 1798, which was the first multi-sectoral institute for practical higher education in the Netherlands. The mission of the Academy Minerva was “The improvement of Drawing, Construction and Nautical Sciences, together with the aligned Arts and Sciences, within all ranks of society, and in particular to improve the skills of the disadvantaged.""[4] Throughout the centuries that followed many more institutions, engaged in a wide range of different fields, were established.

In 1986, Groningen was the first city in the Netherlands where 16 of the 24 vocational schools merged into a larger institute, as recommended in the government paper “Expansion, Division of Tasks, and Concentration in the Higher Educational System”.[4] Hence, Hanze became quickly one of the biggest Universities of Applied Sciences in the nation and data suggests it is growing every year.[5] In 1989 the university joined the Erasmus Programme and in 2014 Hanze became holder of the Erasmus Charter of Higher Education 2014–2020.[6][7]

The name of Hanze UAS is linked to the Hanseatic League (Dutch: Hanze). Groningen, the city hosting the majority of the university's facilities, was member of the Hanseatic League between 1282 and 1669.[8]

delft.txt,delft.txt,"The Delft University of Technology (TU Delft; Dutch: Technische Universiteit Delft) is the oldest and largest Dutch public technical university, located in Delft, Netherlands. As of 2022[update] it is ranked by QS World University Rankings among the top 10 engineering and technology universities in the world.[6] In 2023 it was ranked 2nd in the world in civil engineering, 3rd in the world in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and 3rd in the world in architecture.[7]

With eight faculties and numerous research institutes,[8] it has more than 27,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) and 6,600 employees (teaching, research, support and management staff).[9]

The university was established on 8 January 1842 by King William II as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of training civil servants for work in the Dutch East Indies. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.[1]

Dutch Nobel laureates Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, and Simon van der Meer have been associated with TU Delft. TU Delft is a member of several university federations, including the IDEA League, CESAER, UNITECH International, ENHANCE Alliance, LDE, and 4TU.

Delft University of Technology was founded on 8 January 1842 by William II of the Netherlands as Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade.[1] One of the purposes of the academy was to educate civil servants for the colonies of the Dutch East India Company. The first director of the academy was Antoine Lipkens, constructor of the first Dutch optical telegraph, called simply as Lipkens. Royal Academy had its first building located at Oude Delft 95 in Delft. On 23 May 1863 an Act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the Netherlands, bringing it under the rules of secondary education.

On 20 June 1864, Royal Academy in Delft was disbanded by a Royal Decree, giving a way to a Polytechnic School of Delft (Politechnische School te Delft). The newly formed school educated engineers of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid industrialization period in the 19th century.

Yet another Act, passed on 22 May 1905, changed the name of the school to Technical College (Institute) of Delft (Technische Hoogeschool Delft, from 1934 Technische Hogeschool Delft), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. Polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. The number of students reached 450 around that time. The official opening of the new school was attended by Queen Wilhelmina on 10 July 1905. First dean of the newly established college was ir. J. Kraus, hydraulic engineer. In 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.[10] From 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the Saint Hippolytus Chapel.[11]

Corporate rights were granted to the college on 7 June 1956. Most of the university buildings during that time were located within Delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river Schie, in the Wippolder district.

Student organizations grew together with the university. The first to be established on 22 March 1848 is the Delftsch Studenten Corps housed in the distinctive Sociëteit Phoenix on the Phoenixstraat.  This was followed by the Delftsche Studenten Bond  (est. 30 October 1897) and the KSV Sanctus Virgilius (est. 2 March 1898). In 1917 Proof Garden for Technical Plantation (Dutch: Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen) was established by Gerrit van Iterson, which today is known as Botanical Garden of TU Delft. In that period a first female professor, Toos Korvezee, was appointed.

After the end of World War II, TU Delft increased its rapid academic expansion. Studium Generale was established at all universities in the Netherlands, including TU Delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. Because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first Reception Week for First Year Students (Ontvangst Week voor Eerstejaars Studenten, OWEE) was established, which became a TU Delft tradition since then.

On 1 September 1986, the Delft Institute of Technology officially changed its name to Delft University of Technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. In the course of further expansion, in 1987 Delft Top Tech[12] institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. On 1 September 1997, the 13 faculties of the TU Delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. In the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate emancipation commission. As a result, Girls Study Technology (Meiden studeren techniek) days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.

Since 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of Delft. The relatively new building of Material Sciences department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the Haagse Hogeschool. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many institutes of applied sciences from the Hague region as well as Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between Rotterdamseweg and Leeghwaterstraat.

In 2007 the three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, TU Eindhoven and University of Twente, established a federation, called 3TU.

On 13 May 2008, the building of the Faculty of Architecture was destroyed by fire, presumed caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. Luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by Gerrit Rietveld and Le Corbusier, were saved. The Faculty of Architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.

Through the course of the years the logo of the TU Delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. The current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.[5] The letter ""T"" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that Prometheus brought from Mount Olympus to the people, against the will of Zeus. Because of this, Prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. His statue stood in the center of the newly renovated TU Delft campus, Mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.[13]

Initially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of Delft. This changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. The last university building in the historic centre of Delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. On the 12 September 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, Mekelpark, was officially approved,[14] giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.

New university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating TH Delft professor and WW II resistance fighter, Jan Mekel, who was executed by the Nazis on 2 May 1942 in Sachsenhausen) was opened on 5 July 2009. Mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and filling stations, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.[14] Some of the university buildings around the Mekelpark deserve certain attention.

TU Delft Aula was designed by Van den Broek en Bakema architecture bureau founded by two TU Delft alumni Jo van den Broek and Jaap Bakema. It was officially opened on 6 January 1966 by Dutch Prime Minister Jo Cals. It is a classical example of a structure built in Brutalist style. TU Delft Aula, which symbolically opens the Mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as lecture halls, auditoria, congress center, and administrative offices of the university. All doctoral promotion, honoris causa ceremonies, as well as academic senate meetings take place in the Aula.

The TU Delft Library, constructed in 1997, was designed by Delft-based Mecanoo architecture bureau. It is located behind university aula. The roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. The structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. The library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. All the walls are completely filled with glass. The library won the Dutch National Steel Prize in 1998 in the buildings of steel and hybrid constructions category. The library is also host of the 4TU.Centre for Research Data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the Netherlands.

The TU Delft Sports and Culture Center, recently renamed X, is located at Mekelweg 10, at the edge of the Mekelpark. It was designed by architect Vera Yanovshtchinsky and opened to TU Delft students and staff in 1995. Since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.

Three musea are associated with the university: Science Centre Delft,[15] Mineralogy-geology museum and Beijerinck en Kluyver archive.

Science Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center.[16] Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including Israel and Czech Republic. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of geodesy. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of naval architecture (Werktuig- en Scheepsbouwkunde), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into lofts), Science Centre Delft shows visitors current TU Delft research projects are available, including Eco Runner and Nuna.

Beijerinck en Kluyver archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.

Mineralogy-geology museum is a part of TU Delft Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences and contains around 200,000 geological, mineralogical and crystallographical items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then Delft Royal Academy) was established.

TU Delft botanical garden dates back to 1917, where Proof Garden for Technical Plantation (Dutch: Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen) was established by Gerrit van Iterson Jr., TU Delft graduate and assistant to Martinus Beijerinck.[17] Gerrit van Iterson Jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of tropical agriculture in then Dutch colony of Dutch East Indies.[17] Over 7000 different species of plants, including tropical and subtropical plants, herbs, and ornamental plants cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.[17] Furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's greenhouses. All facilities of TU Delft botanical garden are open to the public.

Along with Delft, UNStudio developed the 'Echo' building on the TU campus for interfaculty lecture halls, study areas, and Cybersecurity research offices. It is an energy-producing building within the campus of Delft which aims at energy conservation to delve into the future.[18]

In September 2016, TU Delft inaugurated a new campus in The Hague.[19] The MSc programme Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA), which teaches students to operate at the intersection of technology and policy when tackling wicked problems, was relocated to this new site to capitalize on its proximity to government ministries, international bodies, and multinational organizations.[19][20]

TU Delft operates the 5th floor of the Wijnhaven Building at Turfmarkt 99 in The Hague, with the rest of the building being occupied by Leiden University.[21] Originally the Ministry of the Interior's headquarters at Schedeldoekshaven 200, the Wijnhaven Building, named after the historic Wijnhavenkwartier, was converted into Campus The Hague in 2016.[22]

In 2023, TU Delft announced plans to further expand its footprint in The Hague by launching a joint university facility with Leiden University at Spui,  set to open in 2025.[23] This new location is expected to accommodate around 600 TU Delft students in the city centre of The Hague.[23]

TU Delft comprises eight faculties.[24] These are (official Dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets):

Since 2004, the TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: the Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, and Doctorate. The academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from September until January and the second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through OpenCourseWare.

As of 2016[update] TU Delft offers 16 BSc programmes.[25] TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught in Dutch, except for Aerospace Engineering, Applied Earth Sciences, Nanobiology, and Computer Science, which are taught entirely in English, and Electrical Engineering which is taught in a mixture of both.

TU Delft offers around 40 MSc programmes.[26] The MSc studies take two years to complete.

TU Delft uses the European Credit Transfer System, where each year MSc students are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. An honours track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in Dutch grading scale) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside the regular MSc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of technology in society. The honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the MSc programme.

MSc programmes are also offered through the 3TU federation, Erasmus Mundus programmes, IDEA League joint MSc programs and QuTech Academy.

Doctoral studies at TU Delft are divided into two phases. The first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. The candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. The research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a doctoral thesis. The thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and external opponents. Once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.

In contrast to US graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving TAs form only a small portion of the programme.

The doctoral defense is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. It lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. Sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by the pedel, who enters the room and says in Latin Hora est (It is time), stamping the university staff on the floor. The committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. Then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the laudation praising the new doctor. The entire ceremony is chaired by the rector or a representative.

TU Delft also offers Professional Doctorate in Engineering.

TU Delft has three officially recognized research institutes: Research Institute for the Built Environment,[27] International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar,[28] and Reactor Institute Delft.[29] In addition to those three institutes, TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology,[30] Kavli Institute of Nanoscience,[31] Materials innovation institute,[32] Astrodynamics and Space Missions,[33] Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute,[34]
TU Delft Safety and Security Institute,[35] and the Delft Space Institute,[36] Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. A complete list of research schools is available on TU Delft website.[8]

Important part of Dutch university system are research schools. They combine education, training and research for PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers in a given field. The main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. Research schools of TU Delft cooperate with other universities in the Netherlands. Research schools are required to have an accreditation of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. TU Delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. The full list of research schools affiliated with TU Delft is available on TU Delft website,[8] see for example TRAIL Research School.

During an academic year the TU Delft publishes a weekly magazine: Delta,[37] which aims at the student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with the last few pages published in English. TU Delta is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. The weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.

Also, approximately four times a year, the TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called Delft Outlook.[38] Delft Outlook is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in Delft Integraal magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. Columns by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.

TU Delft is governed by the executive board (College van Bestuur),[3] controlled and advised by student council, workers council, board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, deans of each TU Delft faculty, and directors of TU Delft research centers, research schools and research institutes.[39]

Executive board is chaired academically by the Rector Magnificus. The currently appointed Rector Magnificus, Tim van der Hagen, has held the position since 2018.[40] He replaced Prof. Ir. Karel Ch.A.M. Luyben[3] who was rector for the period 2010 to 2018. Previous Rectors of TU Delft include Prof. K.F. Wakker (1993–1997 and 1998–2002), Prof. J. Blauwendraad (1997–1998) and Prof. J.T. Fokkema (2002–2010). Executive board is accountable to the Supervisory Board, appointed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science. One of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.

Board of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, research fellows as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. Board of doctorates appoints supervisors for PhD students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers PhD and doctorate Honoris Causa degrees. Committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. Further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. Operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the s. The committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.

Student life at TU Delft is organized around numerous student societies and corporations. They can be generally categorized into professional societies, social societies and sport societies. More than half of TU Delft students belong to an officially recognized society[1].

There are two student parties at TU Delft: ORAS[41] (Organisatie Rationele Studenten) and Lijst Bèta (successor of AAG).[42]  AAG (Afdeling Actie Groepen) started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to AAG. After already taking a break from the yearly elections in 2008, AAG did not participate anymore in the elections of 2010 due to disappointing results.[43] In 2011, a new party was established, Lijst Bèta, that got 2 out of the 10 seats in the student counsil.[44] Since then, Lijst Bèta and ORAS compete each year for seats in TU Delft's Students Council (Studenten Raad). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with The Council of Student Societies Delft VeRa (De VerenigingsRaad) and The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft VSSD (Vereniging voor Studie- en Studentenbelangen Delft).

Apart from bachelor and master student organizations, PhD students of TU Delft have their own organization called Promood (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) (Promovendi Overleg Delft), which represents TU Delft PhD students at the university. It is also a member of Dutch PhD Students Network (Promovendi Netwerk Nederland).

Each faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university,[45] many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example, aerospace engineering department hosts Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management (Stichting Studenten Vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer), while civil engineering department Society for Practical Studies. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including European Association of Aerospace Students.

Apart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a Catholic Wolbodo Student Society, Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft, that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  Besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. One of these is Sint Jansbrug. These societies accept anyone who studies at the TU Delft or any other higher education facility in the Delft area. Also organization that has its roots in Rover Scout movement Delftsche Zwervers (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European AEGEE.

Student sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing society D.S.R.V. Laga and rowing club Proteus-Eretes (both with many Olympic medals won by the members of the club) or American football club Delft Dragons.

TU Delft researchers developed many new technologies used today, including Glare, a Fibre Metal Laminate used in Airbus A380 skin and Vision in Product Design design method. Cees Dekker's lab at TU Delft demonstrated in 1998 the first transistor made out of single nanotube molecule. Delta Works plan was, in part, a child of TU Delft graduates, including Johan Ringers and Victor de Blocq van Kuffeler. TU Delft was a precursor of Open design concept.

In architecture, TU Delft is famous for Traditionalist School in Dutch architecture. TU Delft was a home to many prominent microbiologists including Martinus Beijerinck, who in 1898 discovered viruses while working at TU Delft, and Albert Kluyver, father of comparative microbiology, which resulted in the creation of so-called Delft School of Microbiology.

Some recent projects being developed at the university include:

The majority of TU Delft's students are male. In 2021 among all students of the university (MSc and BSc level) 30% were women. The biggest imbalance between men and women is seen in the Mechanical engineering faculty, while the smallest is seen at Industrial Design and Architecture departments.[51] Despite many efforts of the university to change that imbalance, the number of women studying at TU Delft has stayed relatively constant over the years.[51]

Since 2002 the number of students admitted to TU Delft has increased rapidly (from approximately 2,200 in 2002 to almost 3,700 in 2009).[53] The same applies to the total student population (from approximately 13,250 in 2002 to almost 16,500 in 2009).[53] In 2022, nearly 27 thousand students were enrolled.[52]

The number of international students has also increased steadily.[53] In 2021, 29% of all students at TU Delft came from abroad; nearly three quarters of those came from Europe.[54] The largest proportion of international students at TU Delft in 2022 come from China (14%), followed by India (11.4%) and Belgium (7.4%). The faculties with the highest percentage number of international students study at Aerospace Engineering (46%) and Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (38%).[55]

Due to TU Delft's presence, the city of Delft has one of the biggest populations of Iranians in the Netherlands. It resulted in one of the biggest Iranian protests against the Iranian government in Europe,[56] with many protests organized at TU Delft campus by Iranian TU Delft students during 2009 Iranian Election Protests.

As of 2015,[update] TU Delft is a home to 437 faculty, with more than 3,375 academic staff.[57] The responsibility of TU Delft professors is lecturing, guiding undergraduate and graduate students, as well as performing original research in their respective fields.

Many notable people were TU Delft faculty. In science, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a 1913 Nobel Laureate in physics, a discoverer of superconductivity, was a former TU Delft faculty member, working as an assistant to Johannes Bosscha. Discoverer of the Prins reaction Hendrik Jacobus Prins, co-founders of National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science Hendrik Anthony Kramers and David van Dantzig, developer of the iodide process Jan Hendrik de Boer, discoverer of the particle spin Ralph Kronig, discoverer of the Einstein–de Haas effect Wander Johannes de Haas and discoverer of hafnium Dirk Coster, all were at some point the faculty members of the university. Faculty members of Delft School of Microbiology were the founder of modern microbiology Martinus Beijerinck and the father of comparative microbiology Albert Kluyver.

In engineering, the inventor of penthode and gyrator Bernard Tellegen and Balthasar van der Pol developer of Van der Pol oscillator, were TU Delft faculty. Currently Vic Hayes, and the father of Wi-Fi, is affiliated with the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management.

Other interesting figures that studied at TU Delft were mathematician Diederik Korteweg, responsible for Korteweg–de Vries equation, who studied at TU Delft before moving to University of Amsterdam and painter Maurits Cornelis Escher who studied at TU Delft for a year. Thomas Jan Stieltjes, co-developer of Riemann–Stieltjes integral studied at TU Delft but never passed his final exams. The internationally renowned graphic designer and industrial designer Piet Zwart studied at the university 1913–1914.

TU Delft alumni who are currently a faculty of other universities include Wilhelmus Luxemburg, Dutch mathematician and California Institute of Technology professor, as well as Walter Lewin, Dutch physicist and former MIT professor, and Alexander van Oudenaarden, Dutch biophysicist, a director of the Hubrecht Institute.

In 1906 TU Delft obtained the right to award PhD degrees. This also marked the date since when the university was able to award honorary doctorates. Between 1906 and 2006 exactly 100 honoris causa degrees have been awarded. Honorary doctoral degrees are awarded to people that presented extraordinary contributions in their respective fields. Some of the most recognized recipients of TU Delft honorary doctorate include:

TU Delft was 47th worldwide in QS WUR 2024, 48th worldwide in THE WUR 2024, 169th worldwide in USNEWS 2022-2023, and 151-200th worldwide in ARWU 2022. It was the 78th best-ranked university worldwide in 2022 in terms of aggregate performance across THE, QS, and ARWU, as reported by ARTU.[71]

TU Delft was 43rd worldwide in the THE World Reputation Rankings 2022.

It was also the 15th most international university worldwide in 2023 according to THE.

TU Delft is ranked a top university for engineering and technology worldwide, being positioned for this subject at 10th place in 2022 by QS World University Rankings,[6] at 21st place in 2022 by Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[72] and respectively at 21st and 7th place for engineering and civil engineering accordingly in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking.[73][74]

In the field of Civil & Structural Engineering, TU Delft has been ranked among the world's top 2 in 2022, in the field of Architecture among the world's top 2 since 2012, and in the field of Mechanical Engineering in the top 5 since 2022 by QS World University Rankings.[75]

TU Delft has formed partnerships with leading universities across Europe for student exchange and combined degree programs.

TU Delft has partnered with many universities worldwide for exchanges.[77]","the delft university of technology (tu delft; dutch: technische universiteit delft) is the oldest and largest dutch public technical university, located in delft, netherlands. as of 2022[update] it is ranked by qs world university rankings among the top 10 engineering and technology universities in the world.[6] in 2023 it was ranked 2nd in the world in civil engineering, 3rd in the world in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and 3rd in the world in architecture.[7]

with eight faculties and numerous research institutes,[8] it has more than 27,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) and 6,600 employees (teaching, research, support and management staff).[9]

the university was established on 8 january 1842 by king william ii as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of training civil servants for work in the dutch east indies. the school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. it changed its name to delft university of technology in 1986.[1]

dutch nobel laureates jacobus henricus van 't hoff, heike kamerlingh onnes, and simon van der meer have been associated with tu delft. tu delft is a member of several university federations, including the idea league, cesaer, unitech international, enhance alliance, lde, and 4tu.

delft university of technology was founded on 8 january 1842 by william ii of the netherlands as royal academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade.[1] one of the purposes of the academy was to educate civil servants for the colonies of the dutch east india company. the first director of the academy was antoine lipkens, constructor of the first dutch optical telegraph, called simply as lipkens. royal academy had its first building located at oude delft 95 in delft. on 23 may 1863 an act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the netherlands, bringing it under the rules of secondary education.

on 20 june 1864, royal academy in delft was disbanded by a royal decree, giving a way to a polytechnic school of delft (politechnische school te delft). the newly formed school educated engineers of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid industrialization period in the 19th century.

yet another act, passed on 22 may 1905, changed the name of the school to technical college (institute) of delft (technische hoogeschool delft, from 1934 technische hogeschool delft), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. the number of students reached 450 around that time. the official opening of the new school was attended by queen wilhelmina on 10 july 1905. first dean of the newly established college was ir. j. kraus, hydraulic engineer. in 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.[10] from 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the saint hippolytus chapel.[11]

corporate rights were granted to the college on 7 june 1956. most of the university buildings during that time were located within delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river schie, in the wippolder district.

student organizations grew together with the university. the first to be established on 22 march 1848 is the delftsch studenten corps housed in the distinctive sociëteit phoenix on the phoenixstraat.  this was followed by the delftsche studenten bond  (est. 30 october 1897) and the ksv sanctus virgilius (est. 2 march 1898). in 1917 proof garden for technical plantation (dutch: cultuurtuin voor technische gewassen) was established by gerrit van iterson, which today is known as botanical garden of tu delft. in that period a first female professor, toos korvezee, was appointed.

after the end of world war ii, tu delft increased its rapid academic expansion. studium generale was established at all universities in the netherlands, including tu delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first reception week for first year students (ontvangst week voor eerstejaars studenten, owee) was established, which became a tu delft tradition since then.

on 1 september 1986, the delft institute of technology officially changed its name to delft university of technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. in the course of further expansion, in 1987 delft top tech[12] institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. on 1 september 1997, the 13 faculties of the tu delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. in the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate emancipation commission. as a result, girls study technology (meiden studeren techniek) days were established. in later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.

since 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of delft. the relatively new building of material sciences department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the haagse hogeschool. closer cooperation between tu delft and dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to delft. in september 2009 many institutes of applied sciences from the hague region as well as institute of applied sciences in rijswijk, transferred to delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between rotterdamseweg and leeghwaterstraat.

in 2007 the three dutch technical universities, tu delft, tu eindhoven and university of twente, established a federation, called 3tu.

on 13 may 2008, the building of the faculty of architecture was destroyed by fire, presumed caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by gerrit rietveld and le corbusier, were saved. the faculty of architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.

through the course of the years the logo of the tu delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. the current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.[5] the letter ""t"" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that prometheus brought from mount olympus to the people, against the will of zeus. because of this, prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. his statue stood in the center of the newly renovated tu delft campus, mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.[13]

initially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of delft. this changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. the last university building in the historic centre of delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. on the 12 september 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, mekelpark, was officially approved,[14] giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. the new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.

new university neighborhood called mekelpark (its name commemorating th delft professor and ww ii resistance fighter, jan mekel, who was executed by the nazis on 2 may 1942 in sachsenhausen) was opened on 5 july 2009. mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and filling stations, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.[14] some of the university buildings around the mekelpark deserve certain attention.

tu delft aula was designed by van den broek en bakema architecture bureau founded by two tu delft alumni jo van den broek and jaap bakema. it was officially opened on 6 january 1966 by dutch prime minister jo cals. it is a classical example of a structure built in brutalist style. tu delft aula, which symbolically opens the mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as lecture halls, auditoria, congress center, and administrative offices of the university. all doctoral promotion, honoris causa ceremonies, as well as academic senate meetings take place in the aula.

the tu delft library, constructed in 1997, was designed by delft-based mecanoo architecture bureau. it is located behind university aula. the roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. the structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. the library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. all the walls are completely filled with glass. the library won the dutch national steel prize in 1998 in the buildings of steel and hybrid constructions category. the library is also host of the 4tu.centre for research data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the netherlands.

the tu delft sports and culture center, recently renamed x, is located at mekelweg 10, at the edge of the mekelpark. it was designed by architect vera yanovshtchinsky and opened to tu delft students and staff in 1995. since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.

three musea are associated with the university: science centre delft,[15] mineralogy-geology museum and beijerinck en kluyver archive.

science centre delft was opened in september 2010 and is located at mijnbouwstraat 120 in delft. science center delft is a successor of technical exhibition center.[16] technical exhibition center was established by a group of tu delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. parts of the collection were shown outside of delft: in the netherlands and abroad, including israel and czech republic. the collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of geodesy. the historical collections of technical exhibition center were moved delft museum of technology, located at ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of naval architecture (werktuig- en scheepsbouwkunde), next to the city center of delft. as delft city council together with tu delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into lofts), science centre delft shows visitors current tu delft research projects are available, including eco runner and nuna.

beijerinck en kluyver archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.

mineralogy-geology museum is a part of tu delft faculty of civil engineering and geosciences and contains around 200,000 geological, mineralogical and crystallographical items divided into numerous sub-collections. the oldest items date back to 1842 when the tu delft (then delft royal academy) was established.

tu delft botanical garden dates back to 1917, where proof garden for technical plantation (dutch: cultuurtuin voor technische gewassen) was established by gerrit van iterson jr., tu delft graduate and assistant to martinus beijerinck.[17] gerrit van iterson jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. creation of botanical gardens at tu delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of tropical agriculture in then dutch colony of dutch east indies.[17] over 7000 different species of plants, including tropical and subtropical plants, herbs, and ornamental plants cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.[17] furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's greenhouses. all facilities of tu delft botanical garden are open to the public.

along with delft, unstudio developed the 'echo' building on the tu campus for interfaculty lecture halls, study areas, and cybersecurity research offices. it is an energy-producing building within the campus of delft which aims at energy conservation to delve into the future.[18]

in september 2016, tu delft inaugurated a new campus in the hague.[19] the msc programme engineering and policy analysis (epa), which teaches students to operate at the intersection of technology and policy when tackling wicked problems, was relocated to this new site to capitalize on its proximity to government ministries, international bodies, and multinational organizations.[19][20]

tu delft operates the 5th floor of the wijnhaven building at turfmarkt 99 in the hague, with the rest of the building being occupied by leiden university.[21] originally the ministry of the interior's headquarters at schedeldoekshaven 200, the wijnhaven building, named after the historic wijnhavenkwartier, was converted into campus the hague in 2016.[22]

in 2023, tu delft announced plans to further expand its footprint in the hague by launching a joint university facility with leiden university at spui,  set to open in 2025.[23] this new location is expected to accommodate around 600 tu delft students in the city centre of the hague.[23]

tu delft comprises eight faculties.[24] these are (official dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets):

since 2004, the tu delft education system is divided into three tiers: the bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate. the academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from september until january and the second semester from the end of january until july. most of the lectures are available through opencourseware.

as of 2016[update] tu delft offers 16 bsc programmes.[25] tu delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. the test project finalizes the bsc studies. all bsc programmes are taught in dutch, except for aerospace engineering, applied earth sciences, nanobiology, and computer science, which are taught entirely in english, and electrical engineering which is taught in a mixture of both.

tu delft offers around 40 msc programmes.[26] the msc studies take two years to complete.

tu delft uses the european credit transfer system, where each year msc students are required to obtain 60 ects points. an honours track exists for motivated msc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in dutch grading scale) and did not fail any courses. this track, associated with 30 ects points, is taken alongside the regular msc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of technology in society. the honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the msc programme.

msc programmes are also offered through the 3tu federation, erasmus mundus programmes, idea league joint msc programs and qutech academy.

doctoral studies at tu delft are divided into two phases. the first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. the candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. the research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a doctoral thesis. the thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of tu delft professors and external opponents. once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.

in contrast to us graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving tas form only a small portion of the programme.

the doctoral defense is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. it lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. the defense is ended by the pedel, who enters the room and says in latin hora est (it is time), stamping the university staff on the floor. the committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the laudation praising the new doctor. the entire ceremony is chaired by the rector or a representative.

tu delft also offers professional doctorate in engineering.

tu delft has three officially recognized research institutes: research institute for the built environment,[27] international research centre for telecommunications-transmission and radar,[28] and reactor institute delft.[29] in addition to those three institutes, tu delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the delft institute of microelectronics and submicron technology,[30] kavli institute of nanoscience,[31] materials innovation institute,[32] astrodynamics and space missions,[33] delft university wind energy research institute,[34]
tu delft safety and security institute,[35] and the delft space institute,[36] delft institute of applied mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. a complete list of research schools is available on tu delft website.[8]

important part of dutch university system are research schools. they combine education, training and research for phd candidates and postdoctoral researchers in a given field. the main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. research schools of tu delft cooperate with other universities in the netherlands. research schools are required to have an accreditation of royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences. tu delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. the full list of research schools affiliated with tu delft is available on tu delft website,[8] see for example trail research school.

during an academic year the tu delft publishes a weekly magazine: delta,[37] which aims at the student and employee community of the university. the newspaper is predominantly in dutch, with the last few pages published in english. tu delta is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the internet. articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. the weekly agenda including phd promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.

also, approximately four times a year, the tu delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called delft outlook.[38] delft outlook is published in english, while the same content is published in dutch in delft integraal magazine. both magazines present interviews with tu delft researchers, university officials. columns by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published phd theses.

tu delft is governed by the executive board (college van bestuur),[3] controlled and advised by student council, workers council, board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, deans of each tu delft faculty, and directors of tu delft research centers, research schools and research institutes.[39]

executive board is chaired academically by the rector magnificus. the currently appointed rector magnificus, tim van der hagen, has held the position since 2018.[40] he replaced prof. ir. karel ch.a.m. luyben[3] who was rector for the period 2010 to 2018. previous rectors of tu delft include prof. k.f. wakker (1993–1997 and 1998–2002), prof. j. blauwendraad (1997–1998) and prof. j.t. fokkema (2002–2010). executive board is accountable to the supervisory board, appointed by the minister of education, culture and science. one of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.

board of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, research fellows as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. board of doctorates appoints supervisors for phd students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers phd and doctorate honoris causa degrees. committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the s. the committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.

student life at tu delft is organized around numerous student societies and corporations. they can be generally categorized into professional societies, social societies and sport societies. more than half of tu delft students belong to an officially recognized society[1].

there are two student parties at tu delft: oras[41] (organisatie rationele studenten) and lijst bèta (successor of aag).[42]  aag (afdeling actie groepen) started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then polytechnic institute delft. oras became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to aag. after already taking a break from the yearly elections in 2008, aag did not participate anymore in the elections of 2010 due to disappointing results.[43] in 2011, a new party was established, lijst bèta, that got 2 out of the 10 seats in the student counsil.[44] since then, lijst bèta and oras compete each year for seats in tu delft's students council (studenten raad). further, all student organizations of tu delft are associated with the council of student societies delft vera (de verenigingsraad) and the society for study and student matters delft vssd (vereniging voor studie- en studentenbelangen delft).

apart from bachelor and master student organizations, phd students of tu delft have their own organization called promood (phd students discussion group delft) (promovendi overleg delft), which represents tu delft phd students at the university. it is also a member of dutch phd students network (promovendi netwerk nederland).

each faculty of tu delft has its own set of professional student organizations. numerous societies are present at the university,[45] many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. for example, aerospace engineering department hosts foundation for students in airplane development, manufacturing and management (stichting studenten vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer), while civil engineering department society for practical studies. international professional student organizations are also present at tu delft, including european association of aerospace students.

apart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a catholic wolbodo student society, katholieke studentenvereniging sanctus virgilius delft, that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. one of these is sint jansbrug. these societies accept anyone who studies at the tu delft or any other higher education facility in the delft area. also organization that has its roots in rover scout movement delftsche zwervers (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the european aegee.

student sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. those include rowing society d.s.r.v. laga and rowing club proteus-eretes (both with many olympic medals won by the members of the club) or american football club delft dragons.

tu delft researchers developed many new technologies used today, including glare, a fibre metal laminate used in airbus a380 skin and vision in product design design method. cees dekker's lab at tu delft demonstrated in 1998 the first transistor made out of single nanotube molecule. delta works plan was, in part, a child of tu delft graduates, including johan ringers and victor de blocq van kuffeler. tu delft was a precursor of open design concept.

in architecture, tu delft is famous for traditionalist school in dutch architecture. tu delft was a home to many prominent microbiologists including martinus beijerinck, who in 1898 discovered viruses while working at tu delft, and albert kluyver, father of comparative microbiology, which resulted in the creation of so-called delft school of microbiology.

Erasmus University Rotterdam (abbreviated as EUR, Dutch: Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam [eːˌrɑsmʏs ynivɛrsiˌtɛit rɔtərˈdɑm]) is a public research university located in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The university is named after Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus, a 15th-century Christian humanist and theologian.

Erasmus MC is the largest and one of the foremost academic medical centers and trauma centers in the Netherlands, whereas its economics and business school, Erasmus School of Economics and Rotterdam School of Management are well known in Europe.

Erasmus University Rotterdam was founded on 8 November 1913 as the Netherlands School of Commerce (Nederlandsche Handels-Hoogeschool, or NHH) through private initiative with broad support from the business community of Rotterdam.[5] In 1937, the school was recognized as a higher educational institute with university status, providing education in commerce and economics as an academic discipline. This resulted in a change of its name: the NHH became the NEH, or Netherlands School of Economics (Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool). The growing complexity of society led in the 1960s, to the arrival of the faculties of Law and Social Sciences, followed in later decades by Philosophy, History and Arts, and Business Administration.

From 1950, the Foundation for Higher Clinical Education used its best efforts to get a full academic medical study programme established in Rotterdam, and with success: In 1966, the government established the Medical Faculty Rotterdam (Medische Faculteit Rotterdam), housed next to Dijkzigt Hospital. Together with the Sophia Children's Hospital and the Daniel den Hoed Clinic, it forms the University Hospital Rotterdam, which as of 1 January 2003, bears the name Erasmus MC.
In 1973, the Medical Faculty Rotterdam and the Netherlands School of Economics merged, after which the institution was renamed under its current name Erasmus University Rotterdam (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) – the first university in the Netherlands named after a person, a man to whom Rotterdam owes the reputation it has held for centuries in the academic world.[6]

This domain includes the Erasmus MC, the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA).

Erasmus MC is the new name for the university medical centre in Rotterdam, which is a merger of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University Hospital Rotterdam (Dijkzigt, Sophia, Daniel den Hoed clinic). The biomedical cluster plays a leading role in the field of analysis of role of individual genes playing role in diseases. The Forensic Molecular Biology department works together with the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). Major long-term genetic epidemiological studies among the elderly and children are Erasmus Rotterdam Health for the Elderly (ERGO) and Generation R respectively.
The Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) forms a bridge between medicine and the health sciences on the one hand and social sciences on the other. The institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) conducts health economic research in collaboration with both the Erasmus MC and the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management.

This area includes the Erasmus School of Economics and the Rotterdam School of Management. Its economics programs and management programs attract students and postgraduates from all over the world.
The research schools Erasmus Institute for Management (ERIM) and the Tinbergen Institute attract PhD students, research fellows, PostDocs and visiting professors of repute from all corners of the world.
Other joint ventures are the English-language programme International Business Administration, the Erasmus Executive Development programme (EED) and the Erasmus University Centre for Contract Research and Business Support (ERBS).

The research focuses on the organisation of business and society. This area has ground in common not only with economics and management, but also with medicine and health sciences.

As one of four concentrations of Erasmus University, culture is defined broadly with focus on the areas of media, cultural economics, and the high arts. Primary research is on society and the arts, including cultural policy, media, and social identity in modern society. Faculty has particular strengths in research, and the students tend to graduate with strong research skills for both academic and field placement.

The Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) is the joint research institute of the Rotterdam School of Management and the Erasmus School of Economics, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam. It aims to bring together top researchers in business and management.

Erasmus University today is seen as the leading university in Econometrics and Operational Research. Jan Tinbergen, Nobel Prize winner for Economics (1969), and Henri Theil founded the Econometric Institute and influenced both Econometrics & Management Science. Tinbergen's theories also had a political inclination, with multiple objectives of price stability and employment and policies to achieve the desired results and stabilizing the economy.

The Tinbergen Institute is a joint institute for research and education in economics, econometrics and finance of the University of Amsterdam, the VU University Amsterdam and the Erasmus University Rotterdam. It is one of the top research institutes and graduate schools in economics and finance in the world.[7] It offers a research master program (MPhil) in economics and finance as well as PhD opportunities.

In association with TU Delft, the TRAIL Research School is the Dutch national research school active in the fields of Transport, Infrastructure, and Logistics.

Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship is an independent research and education organisation that originated from the Erasmus University, centring around entrepreneurship, both locally and globally.[8]

The business school has achieved triple accreditation from the international accrediting bodies of management education; AMBA, EQUIS, and AACSB. Only 100 business schools in the world have acquired triple accreditation, although many schools have a policy of not applying for multiple accreditations.[citation needed]

The Erasmus MC (university medical center) is considered by several major rankings to be a global top institution for clinical medicine, i.e. ranked in the world as 45th in 2020 by Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[38] as 28th in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking[39] and 50th in 2019 by QS World University Rankings.[40]

hague.txt,hague.txt,"The Hague University of Applied Sciences (abbreviated as: THUAS; Dutch: De Haagse Hogeschool) is a university of applied sciences with its campuses located in and around The Hague in the Randstad metropolitan region in the west of the Netherlands. The city is home to the Dutch government, royal family and many major international legal, security and peace institutions. Since the university was founded in 1987 it has expanded to four campuses in the near-side cities of The Hague, Delft and Zoetermeer. The main campus in The Hague is located behind The Hague Hollands Spoor railway station by the Laakhaven Canal.

The Hague University of Applied Sciences is known for the international characteristic of its student population with around 124 nationalities represented on campus.[5] It operates partnerships with companies, public bodies and other organisations in the Haaglanden region, as well as international institutions. The university also offers English proficiency training through its English Language Preparatory School, work placements and international exchanges as part of its international remit. Research activity is high with a range of postgraduate and continuing professional education courses.

There are two types of universities in Dutch higher education: traditional research universities and universities of applied sciences. Research universities are mainly responsible for offering research-oriented courses, whereas universities of applied sciences offer courses that focus on the application of arts and sciences with a focus on training and career preparation.

The Hague University of Applied Sciences was formed on 12 January 1987 through the merger of six municipal and nine special institutions of higher professional education in The Hague. Of these institutions, the  Hogere Technische School voor Bouw- en Waterbouwkunde (Higher Technical School for Architecture and Hydraulic Engineering) was the oldest, with origins tracing back to the Haagsche Teeken-Academie (later Royal Academy of Art) which was founded in 1682.[6] The university officially welcomed its first students on 1 September 1987. In the years that followed, the university continued to expand. In 2003 with the Technische Hogeschool Rijswijk. It moved to the campus of Delft University of Technology and continued as The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This Delft campus opened in 2009. In 2003, the university also started the Academy for IT & Design in Zoetermeer, in close cooperation with the business community there. The Academy is now the Faculty of IT & Design. One of its components, the HBO-ICT degree programme, is located at the Dutch Innovation Park in Zoetermeer. In September 2017, the Physical Education Teacher Training Programme (HALO), Sport Studies and International Sport Management degree programmes moved into Zuiderpark Sports Campus, built on the site where ADO Den Haag's Zuiderpark stadium stood until 2007. The ultramodern complex that replaced the stadium contains various sports facilities as well as 12 lecture halls.

vrije.txt,vrije.txt,"The Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam[a] (abbreviated as VU Amsterdam or simply VU when in context)[6] is a public research university in Amsterdam, Netherlands, being founded in 1880. The VU Amsterdam is one of two large, publicly funded research universities in the city, the other being the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The literal translation of the Dutch name Vrije Universiteit is ""Free University"". ""Free"" refers to independence of the university from both the State and the Dutch Reformed Church. Both within and outside the university, the institution is commonly referred to as ""the VU"".
Although founded as a private institution, the VU has received government funding on a parity basis with public universities since 1970. The university is located on a compact urban campus in the southern Buitenveldert neighbourhood of Amsterdam and adjacent to the modern Zuidas business district.

As of October 2021, the VU had 29,796 registered students,[7] most of whom were full-time students. That year, the university had 2,263 faculty members and researchers, and 1,410 administrative, clerical and technical employees, based on FTE units. The university's annual endowment for 2014 was circa €480 million. About three quarters of this endowment is government funding; the remainder is made up of tuition fees, research grants, and private funding.[7]

The official university seal is entitled The Virgin in the Garden. Personally chosen by Abraham Kuyper, the Reformed-Protestant leader and founder of the university, it depicts a virgin living in freedom in a garden while pointing towards God, referring to the Protestant Reformation in the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th century. In 1990, the university adopted the mythical griffin as its common emblem.[8]

The VU was founded in 1880 by a group of Calvinists led by Abraham Kuyper as the first Protestant university in the Netherlands. Kuyper was a theologian, journalist, politician, and prime minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905. He was a professor of theology at VU as well as the university's first rector magnificus (academic president). Kuyper's worldview and philosophy is referred to as Neo-Calvinism. As a reflection of his beliefs, Vrije Universiteit literally means 'Free University' (or 'Liberated University') to signify independence from both government and church. Teaching at the Vrije Universiteit started in 1880 in a few rooms rented at the Scottish Missionary Church (now the Kleine Komedie theatre), along the Amstel river in Amsterdam's city centre. Here, Kuyper and four fellow professors began lecturing in three faculties: theology, law, and the arts.

In 1884, the Scottish Missionary Church became too small for the growing number of students and the university bought its first building, located at Keizersgracht 162. In the following years, the university acquired more buildings throughout the city. In 1905, VU was formally accredited and granted the legal right to award academic degrees. New faculties were subsequently added to the original three, including a science faculty (1930) and a medical faculty (1950).

Funding for the university was provided through the VU Association, an organization founded by Abraham Kuyper which was firmly rooted within the Calvinist community in the Netherlands. By the end of the 1960s, the university received financial support from more than 200,000 private contributors. Many were making small coin donations collected by some 10,000 (mostly female) fundraisers, who were going door to door with the quintessential green VU collecting box.

It was in the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, that the university's profile changed significantly in many respects.[9]  From 1968 onwards, the university relocated from Amsterdam's city centre to a new, functional campus in the southern Buitenveldert neighbourhood. In order to strengthen academic research, university administrators decided to apply for public funding on parity with public universities, which is guaranteed under the Dutch constitution, and no longer opposed admitting non-Protestant professors and students. As a result, the number of students grew substantially. Against the background of increasing student activism at universities around the world, new student organizations were formed demanding a more democratic academic culture at VU. By the end of the 1970s, the small, elitist Christian institution had all but disappeared and had become a broad, research-oriented university, open to students of diverse backgrounds.

Student numbers continued to grow rapidly in the 21st century: from 15,700 students in 2002 to about 25,000 in 2011, causing growing pains which have resulted in lower student satisfaction and budgetary constraints. The university has embarked on a reform agenda, including a large-scale renewal of campus facilities, austerity programmes and staff reorganizations,[10] which in turn were met with opposition and legal action from trade unions as well as a newly formed grassroots movement of staff and students.[11]

The university's main campus and medical centre are situated in the Buitenveldert neighbourhood, part of the southern district of Amsterdam. The campus occupies about 0.4 km2 (0.15 sq mi) and is built along the 'De Boelelaan', a large east–west thoroughfare. Initially a fairly isolated location surrounded mostly by fields, the campus is now adjacent to the modern Zuidas business district housing some of the largest banks, accounting and law firms in the Netherlands. The VU campus is served by the 51 metro line as well as a number of tram lines and bus routes. It is also within walking distance of the Amsterdam Zuid railway station.

The university's Main Building ('Hoofdgebouw' or HG), established in 1973, is located at the intersection of the Boelelaan and the Buitenveldertselaan. The sixteen-story building is currently undergoing major renovation works.[12] The Main Building is home to the faculties of Arts, Philosophy, Economics and Business, and Theology. The University Library occupies five floors as well as several floors with closed stacks. In addition, the Main Building houses the Aula (main auditorium), the university restaurant, several kiosks, a fair trade store, and the VU bookstore.

On the south side, the Main Building provides access to the campus square ('Campusplein'). Many student organizations have their offices along the campus square entrance. South of the square is the Sciences Building ('Wis- en Natuurkundegebouw' or W&N), another 1970s building. The W&N is housing the faculties of Sciences and Earth and Life Sciences. In the middle of campus square is The Basket, the university bar, as well as a number of volleyball fields. Recent additions to the campus square area include a campus supermarket and an Italian coffeehouse. Also adjacent to the campus square is the modern building of the Institute for Health and Welness, which has been nicknamed the Red Potato after its distinct shape and color. Along the Buitenvelderselaan is the Initium Building, housing the Faculty of Law. 
The arch-shaped building, opened in 2010, now forms the eastern entrance of the VU campus. The Faculty of Social Sciences is located in the Metropolitan Building, technically just off-campus, on the other side of the Buitenveldertselaan. The medical faculty is located on west end of campus, adjacent to the sprawling Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. In 2018, the New University Building was opened and which hosts teaching and research spaces as well as two caffès, an exhibition space, and it is weekly converted in a film screening space. Furthermore, the O|2 lab building is one of the first university buildings in the Netherlands built to accommodate a specific research theme. Lastly, in the O|2 Lab building researchers from VU Amsterdam and Amsterdam UMC - location VUmc jointly tackle socially relevant issues in the field of Human Health & Life Sciences in a state-of-the-art shared research environment.

The satellite campus 'Uilenstede' is located further south, in the municipality of Amstelveen. Uilenstede, built mainly between 1966 and 1970, is home to several large student housing complexes and apartment buildings and the VU Sports Centre. [13] and a campus café. Several of the university's administrative departments are also located at the Uilenstede campus. Uilenstede is served by tram 25 and tram 5. Many of the residential halls at Uilenstede are currently undergoing major renovation works. A new apartment complex for visiting staff and international PhD students on the eastern side of the campus was opened in 2012.[14] The new building was awarded the municipality's architecture prize.[15] A large renovation of the public space, made possible with a grant from the Schiphol Foundation, started in September 2013 and includes the construction of three new squares at the campus.[16]

The Vrije Universiteit is made up of several faculties, responsible for teaching and research, as well as a number of interdisciplinary research institutes. As of 2015, after a number of mergers, these faculties are: Behavioural and Movement Sciences; Dentistry; Earth and Life Sciences; School of Business and Economics; Humanities; Law; Sciences; Social Sciences; Theology; and the VUmc School of Medical Sciences.[17]

The Vrije Universiteit is formally a private institution, part of the VU-VUmc Foundation. The other main institution within this foundation is the VU University Medical Center, which has a separate management structure.

The university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. The Executive Board has general management responsibilities and appoints the deans and professors of the faculties. The Executive Board is accountable to a Supervisory Board, appointed by the members' assembly of the VU Association, a private organization which founded the university in 1880.

The university's Works Council, a body of elected representatives of faculty and staff, as well as the Student Council, have consultation and co-decision rights in some areas of university policy and management. The College of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and chaired by the rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.

Teaching is organized within the several faculties. Together, the faculties offer 50 bachelor's, almost 160 master's, and a number of PhD programmes.

The language of instruction for most bachelor's courses is Dutch. As of fall 2015, the university offers five bachelor's programmes fully in English: Business Analytics (Faculty of Science); Computer Science (Faculty of Science); International Business Administration (School of Business and Economics); Liberal Arts and Sciences (Amsterdam University College), Literature and Society (Faculty of Humanities); and Philosophy, Politics and Economics (Faculty of Humanities).[18] Fall 2018 the English-taught Bachelor programme History and International Studies (Faculty of Humanities) was launched.[19] Additionally, the university-wide VU Honours Programme is taught in English.

Over 130 master's programmes at VU are offered entirely in English.[20] In some master's programmes, international students outnumber the Dutch students by a large margin. The university also maintains a number of bilateral exchange agreements with foreign universities, allowing foreign students to spend one or two semesters at the Vrije Universiteit.[21]

As with all publicly funded universities in the Netherlands, bachelor's and master's students pay tuition fees determined by law. For the academic year 2015/2016, regular tuition fees for bachelor's and master's programmes amount to €1,951 per year for students from the European Union or European Economic Area and €9,000 to €12,000 per year for students from non-EU/EEA countries.[22] Most Dutch students and long-term Dutch resident EU citizens are eligible for government loans or grants to cover tuition and living expenses.

PhD programmes are organized differently. Rather than applying to the university for admission, prospective students must find a (full) professor who has a position for a PhD candidate, called a 'promovendus', and contact him or her directly. Most faculties advertise open positions on their websites. As is common in Dutch universities, 'promovendi' are paid a salary and are considered university employees, therefore they do not pay tuition.

In the CWUR - World University Rankings 2019–2020, the Vrije Universiteit is placed 146th overall in the world.[29]

In the 2023 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, VU was ranked 121st.[30] In the subject area of Arts and Humanities, the VU ranks 87th in the world, while in the field of Social Sciences it ranks 81st.

The Tilburg University Top 100 Worldwide Economics Schools Research Ranking based on research contribution 2016-2020 placed the Vrije Universiteit (39th) in the world.

Like teaching, research at VU is organized mostly along the lines of the ten faculties and their departments. University-wide, four interdisciplinary themes have been determined as the principal focus areas of research:

In addition to faculty research centres and programmes, the university houses several interdisciplinary research institutes.[33] For example, the Amsterdam Institute of Molecules, Medicines and Systems, founded in 2010, consists of 17 research groups in pharmaceutical sciences, life sciences, computational life sciences and molecular sciences at VU. AIMMS focusses on three programs: molecular mechanisms of biological processes, design and characterization of molecules and medicines, and Biomarkers and diagnostics. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam School of Business and Economics is also part of the Tinbergen Institute (together with Erasmus University and University of Amsterdam) for economics and finance subject research and training.

Of the nearly 3,000 academic staff (2,257 in fte) employed at VU in 2012, 42% were female. Almost 80% were of Dutch origin, while about 15% had other European nationalities. The remaining 5% came from Asia, North America, Africa, South America and Oceania.[34] Within the body of academic staff, 29% were PhD candidates employed as junior researchers. In 2012, about 300 PhD dissertations were defended at VU.[35]

In 2012, the European Research Council awarded two starting grants and six advanced grants to VU researchers. In addition, 11 VENI and two VICI grants were awarded within the prestigious Innovational Research Incentives Scheme by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.[36]

In 2013, Professor Piek Vossen (Computational Lexicology) was one of three scholars awarded with the Spinoza Prize, the highest scientific award in the Netherlands.[37]

The University Library holds a relatively large collection of more than 1,000,000 printed items.[38] The library occupies five floors in the university's Main Building, not including closed stacks, while the medical collection is housed at the VU University Medical Center. The library's special collections department holds 70,000 manuscripts and printed items in 26 collections. Important collections include reformation works, original English prints, pamphlets and portraits.[39]

The university's independent newspaper, Ad Valvas, has been in print since 1952. The newspaper formally acquired editorial independence in 1979. Ad Valvas appeared on a weekly basis until fall 2012, when it became as a biweekly magazine. The Ad Valvas magazine focuses primarily on background stories, interviews and op-ed articles, while daily campus news is mostly provided through the newspaper's website.[40]

52°20′02″N 4°51′54″E﻿ / ﻿52.33389°N 4.86500°E﻿ / 52.33389; 4.86500","the vrije universiteit amsterdam[a] (abbreviated as vu amsterdam or simply vu when in context)[6] is a public research university in amsterdam, netherlands, being founded in 1880. the vu amsterdam is one of two large, publicly funded research universities in the city, the other being the university of amsterdam (uva). the literal translation of the dutch name vrije universiteit is ""free university"". ""free"" refers to independence of the university from both the state and the dutch reformed church. both within and outside the university, the institution is commonly referred to as ""the vu"".
although founded as a private institution, the vu has received government funding on a parity basis with public universities since 1970. the university is located on a compact urban campus in the southern buitenveldert neighbourhood of amsterdam and adjacent to the modern zuidas business district.

as of october 2021, the vu had 29,796 registered students,[7] most of whom were full-time students. that year, the university had 2,263 faculty members and researchers, and 1,410 administrative, clerical and technical employees, based on fte units. the university's annual endowment for 2014 was circa €480 million. about three quarters of this endowment is government funding; the remainder is made up of tuition fees, research grants, and private funding.[7]

the official university seal is entitled the virgin in the garden. personally chosen by abraham kuyper, the reformed-protestant leader and founder of the university, it depicts a virgin living in freedom in a garden while pointing towards god, referring to the protestant reformation in the netherlands in the 16th and 17th century. in 1990, the university adopted the mythical griffin as its common emblem.[8]

the vu was founded in 1880 by a group of calvinists led by abraham kuyper as the first protestant university in the netherlands. kuyper was a theologian, journalist, politician, and prime minister of the netherlands from 1901 to 1905. he was a professor of theology at vu as well as the university's first rector magnificus (academic president). kuyper's worldview and philosophy is referred to as neo-calvinism. as a reflection of his beliefs, vrije universiteit literally means 'free university' (or 'liberated university') to signify independence from both government and church. teaching at the vrije universiteit started in 1880 in a few rooms rented at the scottish missionary church (now the kleine komedie theatre), along the amstel river in amsterdam's city centre. here, kuyper and four fellow professors began lecturing in three faculties: theology, law, and the arts.

in 1884, the scottish missionary church became too small for the growing number of students and the university bought its first building, located at keizersgracht 162. in the following years, the university acquired more buildings throughout the city. in 1905, vu was formally accredited and granted the legal right to award academic degrees. new faculties were subsequently added to the original three, including a science faculty (1930) and a medical faculty (1950).

funding for the university was provided through the vu association, an organization founded by abraham kuyper which was firmly rooted within the calvinist community in the netherlands. by the end of the 1960s, the university received financial support from more than 200,000 private contributors. many were making small coin donations collected by some 10,000 (mostly female) fundraisers, who were going door to door with the quintessential green vu collecting box.

it was in the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, that the university's profile changed significantly in many respects.[9]  from 1968 onwards, the university relocated from amsterdam's city centre to a new, functional campus in the southern buitenveldert neighbourhood. in order to strengthen academic research, university administrators decided to apply for public funding on parity with public universities, which is guaranteed under the dutch constitution, and no longer opposed admitting non-protestant professors and students. as a result, the number of students grew substantially. against the background of increasing student activism at universities around the world, new student organizations were formed demanding a more democratic academic culture at vu. by the end of the 1970s, the small, elitist christian institution had all but disappeared and had become a broad, research-oriented university, open to students of diverse backgrounds.

student numbers continued to grow rapidly in the 21st century: from 15,700 students in 2002 to about 25,000 in 2011, causing growing pains which have resulted in lower student satisfaction and budgetary constraints. the university has embarked on a reform agenda, including a large-scale renewal of campus facilities, austerity programmes and staff reorganizations,[10] which in turn were met with opposition and legal action from trade unions as well as a newly formed grassroots movement of staff and students.[11]

the university's main campus and medical centre are situated in the buitenveldert neighbourhood, part of the southern district of amsterdam. the campus occupies about 0.4 km2 (0.15 sq mi) and is built along the 'de boelelaan', a large east–west thoroughfare. initially a fairly isolated location surrounded mostly by fields, the campus is now adjacent to the modern zuidas business district housing some of the largest banks, accounting and law firms in the netherlands. the vu campus is served by the 51 metro line as well as a number of tram lines and bus routes. it is also within walking distance of the amsterdam zuid railway station.

the university's main building ('hoofdgebouw' or hg), established in 1973, is located at the intersection of the boelelaan and the buitenveldertselaan. the sixteen-story building is currently undergoing major renovation works.[12] the main building is home to the faculties of arts, philosophy, economics and business, and theology. the university library occupies five floors as well as several floors with closed stacks. in addition, the main building houses the aula (main auditorium), the university restaurant, several kiosks, a fair trade store, and the vu bookstore.

on the south side, the main building provides access to the campus square ('campusplein'). many student organizations have their offices along the campus square entrance. south of the square is the sciences building ('wis- en natuurkundegebouw' or w&n), another 1970s building. the w&n is housing the faculties of sciences and earth and life sciences. in the middle of campus square is the basket, the university bar, as well as a number of volleyball fields. recent additions to the campus square area include a campus supermarket and an italian coffeehouse. also adjacent to the campus square is the modern building of the institute for health and welness, which has been nicknamed the red potato after its distinct shape and color. along the buitenvelderselaan is the initium building, housing the faculty of law. 
the arch-shaped building, opened in 2010, now forms the eastern entrance of the vu campus. the faculty of social sciences is located in the metropolitan building, technically just off-campus, on the other side of the buitenveldertselaan. the medical faculty is located on west end of campus, adjacent to the sprawling amsterdam umc, location vumc. in 2018, the new university building was opened and which hosts teaching and research spaces as well as two caffès, an exhibition space, and it is weekly converted in a film screening space. furthermore, the o|2 lab building is one of the first university buildings in the netherlands built to accommodate a specific research theme. lastly, in the o|2 lab building researchers from vu amsterdam and amsterdam umc - location vumc jointly tackle socially relevant issues in the field of human health & life sciences in a state-of-the-art shared research environment.

the satellite campus 'uilenstede' is located further south, in the municipality of amstelveen. uilenstede, built mainly between 1966 and 1970, is home to several large student housing complexes and apartment buildings and the vu sports centre. [13] and a campus café. several of the university's administrative departments are also located at the uilenstede campus. uilenstede is served by tram 25 and tram 5. many of the residential halls at uilenstede are currently undergoing major renovation works. a new apartment complex for visiting staff and international phd students on the eastern side of the campus was opened in 2012.[14] the new building was awarded the municipality's architecture prize.[15] a large renovation of the public space, made possible with a grant from the schiphol foundation, started in september 2013 and includes the construction of three new squares at the campus.[16]

the vrije universiteit is made up of several faculties, responsible for teaching and research, as well as a number of interdisciplinary research institutes. as of 2015, after a number of mergers, these faculties are: behavioural and movement sciences; dentistry; earth and life sciences; school of business and economics; humanities; law; sciences; social sciences; theology; and the vumc school of medical sciences.[17]

the vrije universiteit is formally a private institution, part of the vu-vumc foundation. the other main institution within this foundation is the vu university medical center, which has a separate management structure.

the university is governed by the executive board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. the executive board has general management responsibilities and appoints the deans and professors of the faculties. the executive board is accountable to a supervisory board, appointed by the members' assembly of the vu association, a private organization which founded the university in 1880.

the university's works council, a body of elected representatives of faculty and staff, as well as the student council, have consultation and co-decision rights in some areas of university policy and management. the college of deans, consisting of all faculty deans and chaired by the rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.

teaching is organized within the several faculties. together, the faculties offer 50 bachelor's, almost 160 master's, and a number of phd programmes.

the language of instruction for most bachelor's courses is dutch. as of fall 2015, the university offers five bachelor's programmes fully in english: business analytics (faculty of science); computer science (faculty of science); international business administration (school of business and economics); liberal arts and sciences (amsterdam university college), literature and society (faculty of humanities); and philosophy, politics and economics (faculty of humanities).[18] fall 2018 the english-taught bachelor programme history and international studies (faculty of humanities) was launched.[19] additionally, the university-wide vu honours programme is taught in english.

over 130 master's programmes at vu are offered entirely in english.[20] in some master's programmes, international students outnumber the dutch students by a large margin. the university also maintains a number of bilateral exchange agreements with foreign universities, allowing foreign students to spend one or two semesters at the vrije universiteit.[21]

as with all publicly funded universities in the netherlands, bachelor's and master's students pay tuition fees determined by law. for the academic year 2015/2016, regular tuition fees for bachelor's and master's programmes amount to €1,951 per year for students from the european union or european economic area and €9,000 to €12,000 per year for students from non-eu/eea countries.[22] most dutch students and long-term dutch resident eu citizens are eligible for government loans or grants to cover tuition and living expenses.

phd programmes are organized differently. rather than applying to the university for admission, prospective students must find a (full) professor who has a position for a phd candidate, called a 'promovendus', and contact him or her directly. most faculties advertise open positions on their websites. as is common in dutch universities, 'promovendi' are paid a salary and are considered university employees, therefore they do not pay tuition.

eindhoven.txt,eindhoven.txt,"The Eindhoven University of Technology (Dutch: Technische Universiteit Eindhoven), abbr. TU/e, is a public technical university in the Netherlands, situated at Eindhoven. In 2020–21, around 14,000 students were enrolled in its BSc and MSc programs and around 1350 students were enrolled in its PhD and PDEng programs. In 2021, the TU/e employed around 3900 people.

Eindhoven University of Technology, in the 2019 QS World University Rankings[7] ranked 99th in the world, 34th in Europe, and 3rd in the Netherlands.

TU/e is the Dutch member of the EuroTech Universities Alliance, a strategic partnership of universities of science & technology in Europe: Technical University of Denmark (DTU), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), École Polytechnique (L’X), The Technion, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), and Technical University of Munich (TUM).

The Eindhoven University of Technology was founded as the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven (THE) on 23 June 1956 by the Dutch government. It was the second institute of its kind in the Netherlands, preceded only by Delft University of Technology.

Undergraduate education was given in four- or five-year programs until 2002, styled along the lines of the German system of education; graduates of these programs were granted an engineering title and allowed to prefix their name with the title ir. (an abbreviation of ingenieur; not to be confused with graduates of technical hogescholen, who were engineers abbreviated ing.). Starting in 2002, following the entry into force of the Bologna Accords, the university switched to the bachelor/master structure (students graduating in 2002 were given both an old-style engineering title and a new master's title). The undergraduate programs are now split into two parts, a three-year bachelor program and a two-year master program.

On 3 January 2011, the university's strategic vision document for the period up to 2020, the ""Strategic Plan 2020"", was presented.[8] This vision included establishing a University College to foster both depth, breadth, and societal relevance in engineering education; establishing a combined Graduate School to manage the graduate programs; an increase of the student body by 50 percent; a 50 percent increase in the number of annual PhDs awarded; an increase of knowledge ""valorisation"" (exploitation by industry and society) to a campus-wide score of 4.2; increasing the international position of the university to within the top-100 universities; and increasing the embedding of the university within the city and the Brainport region by transforming the campus into a high-grade science park with laboratories, housing facilities for 700 students and researchers and supporting facilities. The science park was one of the more costly elements of the plan.[9]

All departments and student facilities are centered along the full length of the Groene Loper.

A number of existing buildings have been renovated and some new buildings erected. For existing buildings the aim is to retain as much of the present materials as possible, supplemented with redeveloped portions of the existing premises and new, sustainable materials. The approach adopted for new buildings is to pursue optimal energy neutrality. There are four large projects.[10]

The Eindhoven University of Technology is a public university of the Netherlands. As such its general structure and management is determined by the Wet op het Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (English: Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research). Between that law and the statutes of the university itself, the management of the university is organized according to the following chart:[11]

The day-to-day running of the university is in the hands of the executive board (Dutch: College van Bestuur). The executive board (EB) monitors the academic departments and service organizations, plus the local activities of the Stan Ackermans Institute. The EB consists of three people, plus a secretary:

There are two bodies that supervise the Executive Board:

Most of the work at the university is done in the departments and the service organizations.

Both for the departments and the service organizations, the staff (and students) are involved with the running of the body. For that reason both types of bodies have advisory councils which have advisory and co-decision authorities.

Over the past two decades, the TU/e has increasingly developed commercial interests and off-campus ties. These include commercial agreements and contracts directly between the university and external companies, but also interests in spinoff companies. In order to manage these kinds of contractual obligations the university started the TU/e Holding B.V. in 1997. The Holding is a limited company, dedicated to the commercial exploitation of scientific knowledge.[12]

There university is more than just the departments, research bodies and the students. There are several ancillary activities necessary to the running of the university, activities that cross the boundaries and interests of the different departments. These activities are carried out by the universities' service organizations.

The university has the following service organizations:

Eindhoven is currently (2018) ranked between 51 and 141 in the world (the university itself provides a survey), and a top ten technical university in Europe.

In a 2003 European Commission report, TU/e was ranked as third among European research universities (after Cambridge and Oxford, at equality with TU Munich and thus making it the highest ranked Technical University in Europe), based on the impact of its scientific research.[24]
In 2011 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) rankings,[25] TU/e was placed at the 52-75 bucket internationally in Engineering/Technology and Computer Science ( ENG ) category and at 34th place internationally in the Computer Science subject field.

The scientific departments (or faculties; Dutch: faculteiten) are the primary vehicles for teaching and research in the university. They employ the majority of the academic staff, are responsible for teaching and sponsor the research schools and institutions.

The departments also offer PhD programs (Dutch: promotiefase) whereby a qualified master may earn a PhD Unlike in anglo-saxon countries these are not educational programs, however; rather, a person working towards obtaining the PhD is a research employee of the university.

The TU/e has nine departments:

The university offers honors programs aimed at both bachelor and master students. At the bachelor level it consists of intensive study within eight possible areas or tracks. At the master level it consists of personal leadership and professional development components, over and above the normal masters study.[27]

In 1986, the university started a number of programs for a postgraduate doctorate of engineering (PDEng) together with two other Dutch technological universities (TU Delft and University of Twente). These programs are managed by the Stan Ackermans Institute on behalf of the 4TU Federation.[28] Each program is two years in length. Ten programs are available at the TU/e:[29]

Nationally, more than 3,500 students have earned the postgraduate PDEng degree through this program. On 13 February, Ravi Thakkar was awarded 3000th PDEng diploma at TU/e

The university hosts a number of other educational programs that are in some way related to the main educational programs. These include the teacher's program and an MBA program.

The TU/e participates in a large number of research institutes which balance in different ways between pure science and applied science research. Some of these institutes are bound strictly to the university, others combine research across different universities.

The TU/e is among the world's ten best-performing research universities in terms of research cooperation with industry in 2011 (Number 1 in 2009). Ten to 20 percent of the scientific publications of these ten universities in the period 2006–2008 were the result of partnerships with researchers in industry. As well as TU/e and Delft University of Technology, the top 10 also includes two universities in Japan (Tokyo Institute of Technology and Keio University in Tokyo), two in Sweden (CTH Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm), and one each in Denmark (DTU Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby), Finland (University of Helsinki), Norway (Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim) and the USA (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York).[30]

The admission process is similar to other universities in the Netherlands, especially other 4TU institutions. The university provides various infographics to explain the process in their website.[31]

Some bachelors have a numerus fixus, while others do not.[32] This may differ from year to year.

Due to an agreement, students that have graduated from another 4TU institution may qualify for direct admission.

Fees at the TU/e differ between students, according to the following table from the official website:

Students from countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) may be eligible for a grant or loan from the Dutch government.[34]

TU/e offers a small number of graduate scholarships. Some have requirements in terms of study focus,[35] while others are available to all students.[36] However, in order to qualify one must have already been accepted at the university.[37]

The TU/e plays a central role in the academic, economic and social life of Eindhoven and the surrounding region. In addition the university maintains relations with institutions far beyond that region as well and participates in national and international events (sometimes through the student body).

The TU/e is enormously important to the economy of the Eindhoven region, as well as the wider areas of BrabantStad and the Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven. It provides highly skilled labor for the local knowledge economy and is a knowledge and research partner for technology companies in the area.

The historic basis for the university's role as an economy and research motor was the interaction with Philips. The university was founded primarily to address the need of Philips for local personnel with academic levels of education in electronics, physics, chemistry and later computer science. Later that interest spread to DAF and Royal Dutch Shell (which became the primary employer for graduates of the chemistry department). There was also a synergy with these companies in that senior personnel were hired from them to form the academic staff of the university (which led to the Eindhoven joke that the university trains the engineers and Philips trains the professors).

Changing economic times and business strategies changed the relationship during the 1980s and 1990s. As Philips started moving away from the region, its importance to the region and the university decreased. A struggle for economic survival forced the university to seek closer ties with the city and region of Eindhoven in the 1989–1995 period, resulting in the creation of the Brainport initiative to draw high tech business and industry to the region. The university started expending more effort in knowledge valorisation, in incubating technology startups, in providing direct knowledge support for local technology companies. Also the academic interests of the research shifted with the times, with more effort going into energy efficiency research, green technologies, and other areas of interest driven by social relevance (the call for better technology in the medical field, for example, led to cooperation with the Catharina Hospital and the University of Maastricht medical department and finally the creation of the Biomedical Technology department).

The TU/e is host (and in some cases also commissioner) of a number of highly successful research schools, including the ESI and the DPI. These research institutes are a source of high-tech knowledge for high-tech companies in the area, such as ASML, NXP and FEI. The university also plays a large role as knowledge and personnel supplier to other companies in the High Tech Campus Eindhoven and helps incubate startups through the Eindhoven Twinning Center and The Gate.[38] It is also a knowledge supporter of the automotive industry in the Helmond region. The valorization strategy of TU/e has already led to various spin-offs, including Lusoco, NC Biomatrix,[39] Taylor,[40] SMART Photonics,[41] EFFECT Photonics[42] and MicroAlign.[43] This appears especially the case around integrated photonics, as the last three examples are part of the photonic chip ecosystem PhotonDelta.

In the extended region, the TU/e is part of the backbone of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle.[44] This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the European Union (measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy); the agreement is based on the cooperative triangle that connects the three technical universities in those cities.

As of the summer of 2010, the TU/e is host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute (EEI). The EEI is a virtual research institute (meaning that it doesn't have any actual offices or facilities), which manages and coordinates the activities of a large number of groups and subinstitutes in the general area of sustainable and alternative energy technologies.[45]

The scientific director of the institute is prof.dr.ir. David Smeulders. He is pro forma head of the research department, which is split into four key areas: Built Environment (energy usage and patterns in building, headed by prof.dr.ir. Jan Hensen from the Department of the Built Environment), Future Fuels (headed by prof.dr. Philip de Goey of Mechanical Engineering), Energy Conversion (headed by prof.dr.ir. René Janssen from Chemical Engineering) and Fusion and Plasma (headed by prof.dr. Niek Lopes Cardozo from Physics). The EEI also incorporates the Graduate School on Sustainable Energy, which the TU/e had already established together with the TU Munich and DTU Lyngby. Secretarial services will be provided by the Center Technology for Sustainable Development (TDO) which also already existed at the TU/e (since 1994).[46]

Energy research at the TU/e is among the best in academic Europe (a February 2010 study by Reed Elsevier puts it second only to Imperial College London).[47] This fact, as well as the unique attention to energy in the built-up environment, drew the attention of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The EEI is now a full co-location of EIT's KIC on Sustainable Energy (InnoEnergy).[45]

The TU/e maintains active academic cooperation with sister institutions in many different countries, for example:[48][49]

The TU/e also provides education to an increasing number of foreign students and graduates. According to the 2009 annual report[50] in the academic year 2008–2009 there were 490 exchange students, 103 foreign nationals registered in a bachelor program, 430 in a master program, 158 in a professional doctorate program (79% of the total). In 2009 the university employed 37 foreign professors (15.9% of the total) and 16 foreign associate professors (12.8%). Overall, 29.5% of the university staff was non-Dutch.

In 2011/2012, the TU/e has Erasmus bilateral agreements with many universities in 30 countries across Europe in a diverse range of subjects for student exchange.[51]

In addition to the ""regular"" types of sports practiced among the student body and by the staff, the TU/e collaborates with the student body in a number of ""technology sporting efforts"". These usually take the form of cross-department projects, which makes them multidisciplinary efforts. Some examples include:

TU Eindhoven has over 110 community bodies that members of TU may participate in.[58] They are related to sports, culture, faith, staff, international students and hobbies, as well as university political parties, student teams, and study associations for each faculty.[58]

Currently TU/e has various accredited student teams which address challenges in the fields of sustainability, artificial intelligence, health and mobility.[59]","the eindhoven university of technology (dutch: technische universiteit eindhoven), abbr. tu/e, is a public technical university in the netherlands, situated at eindhoven. in 2020–21, around 14,000 students were enrolled in its bsc and msc programs and around 1350 students were enrolled in its phd and pdeng programs. in 2021, the tu/e employed around 3900 people.

eindhoven university of technology, in the 2019 qs world university rankings[7] ranked 99th in the world, 34th in europe, and 3rd in the netherlands.

tu/e is the dutch member of the eurotech universities alliance, a strategic partnership of universities of science & technology in europe: technical university of denmark (dtu), école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne (epfl), école polytechnique (l’x), the technion, eindhoven university of technology (tu/e), and technical university of munich (tum).

abbr . TU / e , be a public technical university in the Netherlands , situate at Eindhoven . in 2020–21 , around 14,000 student be enrol in its BSc and MSc program and around 1350 student be enrol in its phd and PDEng program . in 2021 , the TU / e employ around 3900 people . 

 Eindhoven University of Technology , in the 2019 QS World University rankings[7 ] rank 99th in the world , 34th in Europe , and 3rd in the Netherlands . 

 TU / e be the dutch member of the EuroTech Universities Alliance , a strategic partnership of university of science & technology in Europe : Technical University of Denmark ( DTU ) , École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , École Polytechnique ( l’x ) , the Technion , Eindhoven University of Technology ( TU / e ) , and Technical University of Munich ( TUM ) . 

 the Eindhoven University of Technology be found as the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven ( THE ) on 23 June 1956 by the dutch government . it be the second institute of its kind in the Netherlands , precede only by Delft University of Technology . 

 Undergraduate education be give in four- or five - year program until 2002 , style along the line of the german system of education ; graduate of these program be grant an engineering title and allow to prefix their name with the title ir . ( an abbreviation of ingenieur ; not to be confuse with graduate of technical hogescholen , who be engineer abbreviate ing . ) . start in 2002 , follow the entry into force of the Bologna Accords , the university switch to the bachelor / master structure ( student graduate in 2002 be give both an old - style engineering title and a new master 's title ) . the undergraduate program be now split into two part , a three - year bachelor program and a two - year master program . 

 on 3 January 2011 , the university 's strategic vision document for the period up to 2020 , the "" Strategic Plan 2020 "" , be presented.[8 ] this vision include establish a University College to foster both depth , breadth , and societal relevance in engineering education ; establish a combine Graduate School to manage the graduate program ; an increase of the student body by 50 percent ; a 50 percent increase in the number of annual PhDs award ; an increase of knowledge "" valorisation "" ( exploitation by industry and society ) to a campus - wide score of 4.2 ; increase the international position of the university to within the top-100 university ; and increase the embedding of the university within the city and the Brainport region by transform the campus into a high - grade science park with laboratory , housing facility for 700 student and researcher and support facility . the science park be one of the more costly element of the plan.[9 ] 

 all department and student facility be center along the full length of the Groene Loper . 

 a number of exist building have be renovate and some new building erect . for exist building the aim be to retain as much of the present material as possible , supplement with redevelop portion of the exist premise and new , sustainable material . the approach adopt for new building be to pursue optimal energy neutrality . there be four large projects.[10 ] 

 the Eindhoven University of Technology be a public university of the Netherlands . as such its general structure and management be determine by the Wet op het Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek ( English : Law on high Education and Scientific Research ) . between that law and the statute of the university itself , the management of the university be organize accord to the following chart:[11 ] 

 the day - to - day running of the university be in the hand of the executive board ( Dutch : College van Bestuur ) . the executive board ( EB ) monitor the academic department and service organization , plus the local activity of the Stan Ackermans Institute . the EB consist of three people , plus a secretary : 

 there be two body that supervise the Executive Board : 

 Most of the work at the university be do in the department and the service organization . 

 both for the department and the service organization , the staff ( and student ) be involve with the running of the body . for that reason both type of body have advisory council which have advisory and co - decision authority . 

 over the past two decade , the TU / e have increasingly develop commercial interest and off - campus tie . these include commercial agreement and contract directly between the university and external company , but also interest in spinoff company . in order to manage these kind of contractual obligation the university start the TU / e Holding B.V. in 1997 . the Holding be a limited company , dedicate to the commercial exploitation of scientific knowledge.[12 ] 

 there university be more than just the department , research body and the student . there be several ancillary activity necessary to the running of the university , activity that cross the boundary and interest of the different department . these activity be carry out by the university ' service organization . 

 the university have the following service organization : 

 DAZ 

 CEC 

 DPO 

 DFEZ 

 DH 

 ICT 

 IEC 

 DIZ 

 STU

 Eindhoven be currently ( 2018 ) rank between 51 and 141 in the world ( the university itself provide a survey ) , and a top ten technical university in Europe . 

 in a 2003 European Commission report , TU / e be rank as third among european research university ( after Cambridge and Oxford , at equality with TU Munich and thus make it the high rank Technical University in Europe ) , base on the impact of its scientific research.[24 ] 
 in 2011 Academic Ranking of World Universities ( ARWU ) rankings,[25 ] TU / e be place at the 52 - 75 bucket internationally in Engineering / Technology and Computer Science ( ENG ) category and at 34th place internationally in the Computer Science subject field . 

 the scientific department ( or faculty ; Dutch : faculteiten ) be the primary vehicle for teaching and research in the university . they employ the majority of the academic staff , be responsible for teaching and sponsor the research school and institution . 

 the department also offer phd program ( Dutch : promotiefase ) whereby a qualified master may earn a phd unlike in anglo - saxon country these be not educational program , however ; rather , a person work towards obtain the phd be a research employee of the university . 

 the TU / e have nine department : 

 the university offer honor program aim at both bachelor and master student . at the bachelor level it consist of intensive study within eight possible area or track . at the master level it consist of personal leadership and professional development component , over and above the normal master study.[27 ] 

 in 1986 , the university start a number of program for a postgraduate doctorate of engineering ( PDEng ) together with two other dutch technological university ( TU Delft and University of Twente ) . these program be manage by the Stan Ackermans Institute on behalf of the 4tu Federation.[28 ] each program be two year in length . ten program be available at the TU / e:[29 ] 

 nationally , more than 3,500 student have earn the postgraduate PDEng degree through this program . on 13 February , Ravi Thakkar be award 3000th PDEng diploma at TU / e 

 the university host a number of other educational program that be in some way relate to the main educational program . these include the teacher 's program and an MBA program . 

 the TU / e participate in a large number of research institute which balance in different way between pure science and apply science research . some of these institute be bind strictly to the university , other combine research across different university . 

 the TU / e be among the world 's ten well - perform research university in term of research cooperation with industry in 2011 ( number 1 in 2009 ) . ten to 20 percent of the scientific publication of these ten university in the period 2006–2008 be the result of partnership with researcher in industry . as well as TU / e and Delft University of Technology , the top 10 also include two university in Japan ( Tokyo Institute of Technology and Keio University in Tokyo ) , two in Sweden ( CTH Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm ) , and one each in Denmark ( DTU Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby ) , Finland ( University of Helsinki ) , Norway ( Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim ) and the USA ( Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , New York).[30 ] 

 the admission process be similar to other university in the Netherlands , especially other 4tu institution . the university provide various infographic to explain the process in their website.[31 ] 

 some bachelor have a numerus fixus , while other do not.[32 ] this may differ from year to year . 

 due to an agreement , student that have graduate from another 4tu institution may qualify for direct admission . 

 fee at the TU / e differ between student , accord to the follow table from the official website : 

 student from country of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) may be eligible for a grant or loan   from the Dutch government.[34 ] 

 TU / e offer a small number of graduate scholarship . some have requirement in term of study focus,[35 ] while other be available to all students.[36 ] however , in order to qualify one must have already be accept at the university.[37 ] 

 the TU / e play a central role in the academic , economic and social life of Eindhoven and the surround region . in addition the university maintain relation with institution far beyond that region as well and participate in national and international event ( sometimes through the student body ) . 

 the TU / e be enormously important to the economy of the Eindhoven region , as well as the wide area of BrabantStad and the Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven . it provide highly skilled labor for the local knowledge economy and be a knowledge and research partner for technology company in the area . 

 the historic basis for the university 's role as an economy and research motor be the interaction with Philips . the university be found primarily to address the need of Philips for local personnel with academic level of education in electronic , physics , chemistry and later computer science . later that interest spread to DAF and Royal Dutch Shell ( which become the primary employer for graduate of the chemistry department ) . there be also a synergy with these company in that senior personnel be hire from they to form the academic staff of the university ( which lead to the Eindhoven joke that the university train the engineer and Philips train the professor ) . 

 change economic time and business strategy change the relationship during the 1980 and 1990 . as Philips start move away from the region , its importance to the region and the university decrease . a struggle for economic survival force the university to seek close tie with the city and region of Eindhoven in the 1989–1995 period , result in the creation of the Brainport initiative to draw high tech business and industry to the region . the university start expend more effort in knowledge valorisation , in incubate technology startup , in provide direct knowledge support for local technology company . also the academic interest of the research shift with the time , with more effort go into energy efficiency research , green technology , and other area of interest drive by social relevance ( the call for well technology in the medical field , for example , lead to cooperation with the Catharina Hospital and the University of Maastricht medical department and finally the creation of the Biomedical Technology department ) . 

 the TU / e be host ( and in some case also commissioner ) of a number of highly successful research school , include the ESI and the DPI . these research institute be a source of high - tech knowledge for high - tech company in the area , such as ASML , NXP and FEI . the university also play a large role as knowledge and personnel supplier to other company in the High Tech Campus Eindhoven and help incubate startup through the Eindhoven Twinning Center and the gate.[38 ] it be also a knowledge supporter of the automotive industry in the Helmond region . the valorization strategy of TU / e have already lead to various spin - off , include Lusoco , NC Biomatrix,[39 ] Taylor,[40 ] SMART photonics,[41 ] effect photonics[42 ] and microalign.[43 ] this appear especially the case around integrated photonic , as the last three example be part of the photonic chip ecosystem PhotonDelta . 

 in the extended region , the TU / e be part of the backbone of the Eindhoven - Leuven - Aachen triangle.[44 ] this economic cooperation agreement between three city in three country have create one of the most innovative region in the European Union ( measure in term of money invest in technology and knowledge economy ) ; the agreement be base on the cooperative triangle that connect the three technical university in those city . 

 as of the summer of 2010 , the TU / e be host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute ( EEI ) . the eei be a virtual research institute ( mean that it do not have any actual office or facility ) , which manage and coordinate the activity of a large number of group and subinstitute in the general area of sustainable and alternative energy technologies.[45 ] 

 the scientific director of the institute be prof.dr.ir . David Smeulders . he be pro forma head of the research department , which be split into four key area : build Environment ( energy usage and pattern in building , head by prof.dr.ir . Jan Hensen from the Department of the Built Environment ) , Future Fuels ( head by prof.dr . Philip de Goey of Mechanical Engineering ) , Energy Conversion ( head by prof.dr.ir . René Janssen from Chemical Engineering ) and Fusion and Plasma ( head by prof.dr . Niek Lopes Cardozo from Physics ) . the eei also incorporate the Graduate School on sustainable energy , which the TU / e have already establish together with the TU Munich and DTU Lyngby . secretarial service will be provide by the Center Technology for Sustainable Development ( TDO ) which also already exist at the TU / e ( since 1994).[46 ] 

 energy research at the TU / e be among the good in academic Europe ( a February 2010 study by Reed elsevier put it second only to Imperial College London).[47 ] this fact , as well as the unique attention to energy in the build - up environment , draw the attention of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology . the EEI be now a full co - location of EIT 's KIC on sustainable Energy ( InnoEnergy).[45 ] 

 the TU / e maintain active academic cooperation with sister institution in many different country , for example:[48][49 ] 

 the TU / e also provide education to an increase number of foreign student and graduate . accord to the 2009 annual report[50 ] in the academic year 2008–2009 there be 490 exchange student , 103 foreign national register in a bachelor program , 430 in a master program , 158 in a professional doctorate program ( 79 % of the total ) . in 2009 the university employ 37 foreign professor ( 15.9 % of the total ) and 16 foreign associate professor ( 12.8 % ) . overall , 29.5 % of the university staff be non - dutch . 

 in 2011/2012 , the TU / e have Erasmus bilateral agreement with many university in 30 country across Europe in a diverse range of subject for student exchange.[51 ] 

 in addition to the "" regular "" type of sport practice among the student body and by the staff , the TU / e collaborate with the student body in a number of "" technology sporting effort "" . these usually take the form of cross - department project , which make they multidisciplinary effort . some example include : 

 TU Eindhoven have over 110 community body that member of TU may participate in.[58 ] they be relate to sport , culture , faith , staff , international student and hobby , as well as university political party , student team , and study association for each faculty.[58 ] 

 currently TU / e have various accredited student team which address challenge in the field of sustainability , artificial intelligence , health and mobility.[59 ]",DET PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT

twente.txt,twente.txt,"The University of Twente (Dutch: Universiteit Twente; Dutch pronunciation: [ynivɛrsiˈtɛit ˈtʋɛntə], abbr. UT) is a public technical university located in Enschede, Netherlands.
The university has been placed in the top 170 universities in the world by multiple central ranking tables. In addition, the UT was ranked the best technical university in The Netherlands by Keuzegids Universiteiten, the most significant national university ranking.
The UT collaborates with Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology and the Wageningen University and Research Centre under the umbrella of 4TU and is also a partner in the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU).

The university was founded in 1961 as Technische Hogeschool Twente (THT). After Delft University of Technology and Eindhoven University of Technology, it became the third polytechnic institute in the Netherlands to become a university. The institution was later renamed to Universiteit Twente (University of Twente) in 1986, as the result of the changes in the Dutch Academic Education Act in 1984.

The Dutch government's decision to locate the country's third technical university in Enschede, the main city of Twente, had much to do with the north-eastern province's rich manufacturing industry (textiles, metal, electrical engineering, chemicals). Another important consideration was the fact that the local economy needed a boost to compensate for the dwindling textile industry. The municipality of Enschede made the Drienerlo estate available for the first campus University of the Netherlands.[3][4]

The University of Twente was built on the former country estate of Drienerlo, situated between Hengelo and Enschede. The 140-hectare estate consists of woodland, meadows and water. Architects Van Tijen and Van Embden designed the first — and so far only — Dutch campus university along American lines where students and staff live, work and pursue their leisure activities on campus.[5]

The Student Union, which is run entirely by students, manages several premises, including the student social centre (De Pakkerij) and study centre (Wallstreet) in Enschede and The Water sports complex on the Twentekanaal.[6]

According to the Times Higher Education Ranking, the University of Twente is considered one of the 200 most prestigious universities globally.[7] The university performed particularly strongly in the Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 2021 ranking. Here, the university was ranked eleventh in the world rankings.[8] At the same time, psychology and social sciences also performed well, receiving 101–125 in the world rankings.[7]

In the Shanghai Ranking 2021, the University of Twente's Geoinformation and Earth Observation Sciences were awarded. In the field of remote sensing, the university landed among the top ten universities in the world.[15] The commitment in this area will be further expanded in the coming years.[16]

According to Keuzegids Universiteiten, the most significant national university ranking, the University of Twente is the best technical university in the Netherlands.[17]

The current rector magnificus of the university is professor Tom Veldkamp. The other two members of the executive board are Vinod Subramaniam (president of the executive board) and Machteld Roos (vice-president)[18]

There are five faculties at the University of Twente; each faculty is in turn organized into several departments:

Next to the programmes administered by the faculties mentioned above, University College Twente offers the broad honours BSc programme in Technology and Liberal Arts and Sciences, or ATLAS for short, and the Twente Graduate School offers post graduate education (PhD and PDEng).[19] Since 2019, this study is part of the faculty ITC.

The University of Twente has the following faculties with corresponding bachelor- and master programmes:

BMS (Behavioural, Management & Social Sciences)



ET (Engineering Technology)



EEMCS (Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science) (a.k.a. EWI)



ST (Science and Technology) (a.k.a. TNW)



ITC (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation)



The degree programs at the University of Twente range from business administration and psychology to applied physics, engineering and biomedical technology.

In the applied sciences, the emphasis is on nanotechnology, process technology, engineering, information and communication technology, and the biomedical sciences.

So far, the UT has produced over 1,000 spin-off companies and start-up companies; more than any other Dutch university.[20] UT is also one of the founders of Novel-T, formerly Stichting Kennispark Twente, a startup accelerator and support program for university spin-offs.[21][22]","the university of twente (dutch: universiteit twente; dutch pronunciation: [ynivɛrsiˈtɛit ˈtʋɛntə], abbr. ut) is a public technical university located in enschede, netherlands.
